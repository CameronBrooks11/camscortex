# naming convetions of applications, projects and repositories

When naming applications, repositories, and general projects, different conventions have their advantages depending on readability, compatibility, and usage context. Below are the common naming styles:

## PascalCase

- Example: `ExampleLibrary`
- Common in programming for libraries, class names, and frameworks.
- Less readable in URLs and file paths.

## camelCase

- Example: `exampleLibrary`
- Similar to PascalCase but starts with a lowercase letter.
- Often used for variable and function names in programming.
- Not ideal for repository names due to readability issues.

## kebab-case

- Example: `example-library`
- Preferred for repositories, URLs, and command-line tools.
- Improves readability and avoids case sensitivity issues.
- Common in open-source projects.

## snake_case

- Example: `example_library`
- Frequently used in Python and database schemas.
- Less common for repository names but useful for filenames.

### Recommendation

For repository names, **kebab-case** (e.g., `example-library`) is generally the best choice due to its readability, compatibility, and suitability for URLs and command-line usage.
