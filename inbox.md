- Ideas for website
  - Projects but for the site:
    - student tools and tutorials (math, science, grade/GPA calculators, citations, etc.)
    - Map of sciences: math, physics, chemistry, biology, envirisci, psych but then comp sci beside all and below math then a link of math and philosophy which connects with psych then medicine spanning the 3 main scis
  - Blog of people that did/do great things to make the world a better place
- Largely a split between diciplines: (Can we: engineering, CS, science) + (Should: social sci, policy)
  - I think that is more of a general categorization of the means of the various fields
