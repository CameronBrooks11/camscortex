# Zenith Pathways Mentorship Notes

## Space Mentorship Donya Divsalar Meeting Notes

### Meeting 1 2023-03-22 4:00pm EST

- Scratch notes
  - Beauty of space is how broad it is
    - You can put space in front of anything and it becomes a thing
    - It's more broad than you think (equity and what it covers)
  - How to tie space into it, in terms of graduate studies and entrepreneurship
    - Find that gap, even if "people have thought about it" --> this is where you identify how you are different and how your solutions is different
      - This will attract other people to your idea
      - It's about perspetive
    - She started her company at same time as masters
      - It was tough because they drift away in terms of projects, but stays similar in terms of content and learning
      - PI supervision (are they supportive of entrepreneurship) and IP for creating it into a business (very important)
    - It's not just the name (CSA), it's more about networking other academics, engineers, and companies
      - Networking strategically, you want to break into a niche
  - SEDS Canada can be a way to test your completed hardware (specifically non-human flight)
    - They have space flight sims, high-altitude balloons, etc.
    - If you win the competition
  - CSA has testing for students for testing payloads on balloons
  - Can also talk to student teams (satellite, rocket)
    - Get minorly involved with them (sub-teams)
    - Meet like-minded people
  - Breaking into space industry
    - You need to just put yourself out there and start talking
    - Good org: [Space Generation Advisory Council](https://spacegeneration.org/)
      - Mention in application that you are new and looking to get involved
    - Good conference: [International Astronautical Congress IAC](https://www.iafastro.org/events/iac/)
      - Crazy ideas, good networking, not as much for learning hard science
      - CSA not supporting students going this year due to security (they have grants for meals, travel, etc.)
        - ISEB: The International Space Education Board (ISEB) brings together ten space agencies with the aim of increasing STEM literacy and supporting the future workforce needs of space programs.
        - Competitive!!!
        - Need one recommendation letter
    - Don't get stuck just networking with students
      - If you are the smartest in the room then you need a bigger room
      - Keep pushing bigger and broader
    - It's great doing presentations and posters and stuff but networking is more valuable
    - Starting entrepreneurship in grad or not
      - It was good because supervisor became involved into it
      - OS is great but at some point you have to look at what you want to do
      - You get into a loop of what does supervisor want versus what you want, academia eventually ends but this business might be much longer
      - Don't do it if you don't need it. REALLY ASK YOURSELF WHY
        - It can be really rough so you have to love it a lot
        - Scrap the idea of the next logical step if it doesn't help you
        - If you could just do it today could you? What do you need? Grad school? Industry experience?
      - Grad school allowed her to start slowly
    - Again: anything can be space, even "non-space" stuff
      - Find another PI that's space
      - Bridge the two labs
      - CSA, ESA (Canada is member state, they have training, funding; just fun to live in Europe)
    - Do as much fun such as conferences that you can on their dime, make grad time count
      - Also good for exposure and networking
      - Inform people about what you think is important
    - A lot happens in USA that Canadians can do that you think you can't do

### Key Points

    - The main goal was to better understand each other's backgrounds, ambitions, and interests, particularly related to the space industry and graduate studies.
    - The versatility of space was emphasized: one can add 'space' to any concept and create a unique area of study or interest. This breadth implies that there are numerous ways to contribute to and innovate within the industry.
    - To successfully incorporate space into graduate studies or entrepreneurship, it's essential to find a unique niche, even if the idea isn't completely original. It's about offering a new perspective or solution.
    - Networking is critical, not only with institutions like the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) but also with academics, engineers, and other companies in the industry.
    - SEDS Canada was highlighted as a platform for testing completed hardware through non-human flights, space flight simulations, and high-altitude balloons.
    - Resources for students were pointed out, including CSA's testing facilities for payloads on balloons and student teams focusing on satellite and rocket projects.
    - The necessity of actively participating in the space community was stressed, with the Space Generation Advisory Council and the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) recommended as beneficial platforms.
    - It was advised not to limit networking to student circles but to extend it to more experienced individuals in the industry.
    - While presenting and creating posters can be valuable experiences, networking was identified as having a higher return on investment.
    - Balancing academia and entrepreneurship can be challenging, but can also present unique opportunities. However, it's essential to weigh the demands and benefits critically, asking whether grad school or industry experience is genuinely necessary for achieving one's goals.
    - It was underlined that "non-space" fields can also be incorporated into space studies, suggesting potential partnerships between different research labs.
    - Participants were encouraged to leverage opportunities for exposure and networking, such as attending conferences funded by their institutions, and to share their unique insights.
    - There are numerous opportunities in the USA for Canadians interested in the space industry that might be overlooked or assumed inaccessible.

### Insights

- Participants were open and enthusiastic about sharing their experiences and goals, suggesting a supportive and collaborative environment.
- There is a shared belief in the immense potential of the space industry, as well as the importance of finding a unique niche.
- Networking is unanimously seen as a critical aspect of success in the space industry.
- Balancing academia and entrepreneurship is seen as challenging but also as an opportunity for growth and unique experiences.
- The notion that "non-space" fields can be incorporated into space studies indicates an open-mindedness towards interdisciplinary collaboration.
