# Smart Modular & Augmentable Plant Enclosure (SMARE)
- Smart Modular & Augmentable Plant Enclosure (SMARE)
- # Applications
- Microfarms for the decentralized production of local fresh foods.
- Vertical farms to maximize yield per square unit of ground to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture.
- To grow specific species of plants that:
	- require high-maintenance,
	- contain medicinal and/or therapeutic substances,
	- are poisonous, dangerous, or otherwise harmful
	- are being grown hydroponically.
