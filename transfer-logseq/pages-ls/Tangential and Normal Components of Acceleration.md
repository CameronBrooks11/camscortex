## Concept of Acceleration Components
	- Acceleration of a particle is generally not tangent to the path. It's useful to resolve it into tangential and normal components.
- ## Plane Motion of a Particle
	- For a particle moving in a plane:
		- Tangential unit vector \( \mathbf{e}_t \) is along the path, pointing in the direction of motion.
		- Normal unit vector \( \mathbf{e}_n \) is perpendicular to \( \mathbf{e}_t \), towards the center of curvature.
- ## Deriving Normal and Tangential Components
	- Velocity \( \mathbf{v} \) is expressed as \( v\mathbf{e}_t \).
	- Acceleration \( \mathbf{a} \) is derived by differentiating \( v\mathbf{e}_t \): \( \mathbf{a} = \frac{dv}{dt}\mathbf{e}_t + v\frac{d\mathbf{e}_t}{dt} \).
	- \( \frac{d\mathbf{e}_t}{dt} \) is proportional to the normal unit vector \( \mathbf{e}_n \) and inversely proportional to the radius of curvature \( r \).
- ## Scalar Components of Acceleration
	- Tangential component \( a_t = \frac{dv}{dt} \) reflects change in speed.
	- Normal component \( a_n = \frac{v^2}{r} \) reflects change in direction.
- ## Interpretation of Components
	- Positive \( a_t \) implies acceleration in the direction of motion; negative implies deceleration.
	- \( a_n \) is always directed toward the center of curvature.
- ## Application in Design
	- The normal component's dependence on the radius of curvature is considered in designing airplane wings, railroad tracks, and cams to avoid sudden changes in acceleration.
- ## Motion of a Particle in Space
	- The concepts still apply for particles moving in space.
	- The osculating plane at a point on a space curve fits the curve closely and contains the tangent and principal normal vectors.
	- The acceleration can be resolved into components along the tangent and the principal normal, but not along the binormal.
