			- Scratch notes
			  collapsed:: true
				- Beauty of space is how broad it is
					- You can put space in front of anything and it becomes a thing
					- It's more broad than you think (equity and what it covers)
				- How to tie space into it, in terms of graduate studies and entrepreneurship
					- Find that gap, even if "people have thought about it" --> this is where you identify how you are different and how your solutions is different
						- This will attract other people to your idea
						- It's about perspetive
					- She started her company at same time as masters
						- It was tough because they drift away in terms of projects, but stays similar in terms of content and learning
						- PI supervision (are they supportive of entrepreneurship) and IP for creating it into a business (very important)
					- It's not just the name (CSA), it's more about networking other academics, engineers, and companies
						- Networking strategically, you want to break into a niche
				- SEDS Canada can be a way to test your completed hardware (specifically non-human flight)
					- They have space flight sims, high-altitude balloons, etc.
					- If you win the competition
				- CSA has testing for students for testing payloads on balloons
				- Can also talk to student teams (satellite, rocket)
					- Get minorly involved with them (sub-teams)
					- Meet like-minded people
				- Breaking into space industry
					- You need to just put yourself out there and start talking
					- Good org: [Space Generation Advisory Council](https://spacegeneration.org/)
						- Mention in application that you are new and looking to get involved
					- Good conference: [International Astronautical Congress IAC](https://www.iafastro.org/events/iac/)
						- Crazy ideas, good networking, not as much for learning hard science
						- CSA not supporting students going this year due to security (they have grants for meals, travel, etc.)
							- ISEB: The International Space Education Board (ISEB) brings together ten space agencies with the aim of increasing STEM literacy and supporting the future workforce needs of space programs.
							- Competitive!!!
							- Need one recommendation letter
					- Don't get stuck just networking with students
						- If you are the smartest in the room then you need a bigger room
						- Keep pushing bigger and broader
					- It's great doing presentations and posters and stuff but networking is more valuable
					- Starting entrepreneurship in grad or not
						- It was good because supervisor became involved into it
						- OS is great but at some point you have to look at what you want to do
						- You get into a loop of what does supervisor want versus what you want, academia eventually ends but this business might be much longer
						- Don't do it if you don't need it. REALLY ASK YOURSELF WHY
							- It can be really rough so you have to love it a lot
							- Scrap the idea of the next logical step if it doesn't help you
							- If you could just do it today could you? What do you need? Grad school? Industry experience?
						- Grad school allowed her to start slowly
					- Again: anything can be space, even "non-space" stuff
						- Find another PI that's space
						- Bridge the two labs
						- CSA, ESA (Canada is member state, they have training, funding; just fun to live in Europe)
					- Do as much fun such as conferences that you can on their dime, make grad time count
						- Also good for exposure and networking
						- Inform people about what you think is important
					- A lot happens in USA that Canadians can do that you think you can't do

		- [[@A spacecraft-compatible combined artificial gravity and exercise (CAGE) system to sustain astronaut health in the next generation of long-term spaceflight]]
			- Bing AI Summary
			  collapsed:: true
				- The article you mentioned is titled “A spacecraft-compatible combined artificial gravity and exercise (CAGE) system to sustain astronaut health in the next generation of long-term spaceflight” 1. It was published in the Journal of Space Safety Engineering Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2022 1.
				- The article discusses how human spaceflight exposes astronauts to prolonged periods of microgravity and high doses of radiation, leading to life-threatening cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurological damage 2. One of the most dangerous effects of microgravity is the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the intracranial space 2. The authors propose a design for a Combined Artificial Gravity and Exercise (CAGE) device that would be compatible with commercial spacecrafts and space stations as well as Lunar bases 2. The CAGE features a customized squat module built at the circumference of a centrifuge apparatus. Squatting activates a full-body workout that allows for an efficient shift of fluid towards the lower body while preventing muscle and bone density loss 2.

		- [[@Canadian aging and inactivity study: Spaceflight-inspired exercises during head-down tilt bedrest blunted reductions in muscle-pump but not cardiac baroreflex in older persons]]
			- Bing AI Summary
				- As part of the first Canadian aging and inactivity study (CAIS), the authors assessed the efficacy of space-based exercise countermeasures for maintenance of cardiac and muscle-pump baroreflex in older persons during bedrest 1. The study involved 14 days of 6-degree head-down tilt bedrest (HDBR) with (Exercise) or without (Control) combined upper and lower body strength, aerobic, and high-intensity interval training exercise countermeasures 1.
				- The study found that 2 weeks of bedrest impaired skeletal muscle’s ability to return blood to the venous circulation differently across various sexes and intervention groups. The proposed exercises may alleviate muscle-pump baroreflex declines but could not influence the cardiac baroreflex decline from 14 days of inactivity in older adults 3.

		- [[@EXAMINING EFFECTS OF COSMIC RADIATION ON THE ACTIVITY OF HIV-1 LATENCY REVERSAL USING CUBESAT PAYLOADS  IAC Archive — IAC-19/A1/4/6]]
			- Bing AI Summary
				- Here’s a summary of the paper: “Examining Effects of Cosmic Radiation on the Activity of HIV-1 Latency Reversal Using Cubesat Payloads” is a paper by Donya Naz Divsalar and others. The paper discusses how Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV replication but does not act on latent viral reservoirs. “Shock and kill” therapeutic approaches aim to re-awaken viral expression in HIV reservoir-containing cells and target those cells for elimination. Latency Reversal Agents (LRAs) that effectively stimulate virus production could potentially reduce viral persistence in people living with HIV. The experiment is designed to determine the effect of exposure to cosmic radiation on the activity of LRAs using Cubesat technology. A modified version of the experiment will be conducted as a payload of a 3U Cubesat developed by the SFU Satellite Design team with a projected launch date into lower Earth orbit in summer 2021. The findings from this experiment will inform drug responsiveness under exposure to radiation and contribute to development of an approach to manage and potentially find a cure for HIV using emerging aerospace technologies.

		- [[@IAF EARTH OBSERVATION SYMPOSIUM (B1) Earth Observation Applications, Societal Challenges and Economic Beneﬁts (5)]]
			- Bing AI Summary
				- Based on the abstract you provided, the paper discusses the design of ALEASAT, a 1U Earth-imaging CubeSat that aims to provide on-demand satellite imagery directly to Amateur Radio Operators (AROs) during disaster relief efforts. The paper highlights the challenges faced by traditional disaster relief efforts in retrieving data from current Earth observation satellites through conventional communication infrastructure, which may fail during an emergency. ALEASAT addresses this shortcoming by allowing AROs to send a request with a set of coordinates to the ALEASAT team, who will approve the request and provide an authentication key for direct communication with ALEASAT. During the next available pass, ALEASAT will capture the image and the ARO can retrieve it directly from the satellite.
