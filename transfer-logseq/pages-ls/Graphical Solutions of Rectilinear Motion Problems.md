## Fundamental Formulas and Geometrical Significance
	- The formulas \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \) and \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \) are fundamental in describing motion.
	- Geometrically, \( v \) equals the slope of the \( x \)-\( t \) curve, and \( a \) equals the slope of the \( v \)-\( t \) curve.
- ## Graphical Determination of Motion Curves
	- The \( v \)-\( t \) and \( a \)-\( t \) curves can be graphically determined from the \( x \)-\( t \) curve.
	- Integration of these formulas between two times \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) can be used to derive motion characteristics.
- ### Area Under Curves
	- The area under the \( v \)-\( t \) curve between \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) equals the change in \( x \) in that interval.
	- The area under the \( a \)-\( t \) curve equals the change in \( v \) over the same period.
- ## Utilization of Graphical Solutions
	- Useful for analyzing motion from experimental data or when \( x \), \( v \), and \( a \) are not analytical functions of \( t \).
	- Helpful for motions consisting of distinct parts requiring different equations.
- ### Precautions in Graphical Solutions
	- Areas under curves represent changes in \( x \) or \( v \), not the absolute values.
	- Areas above the \( t \) axis indicate an increase in \( x \) or \( v \), while those below indicate a decrease.
- ### Representing Constant Velocity and Acceleration
	- Constant velocity is represented by a horizontal line on the \( v \)-\( t \) graph.
	- Constant acceleration appears as a horizontal line on the \( a \)-\( t \) graph.
- ### Polynomial Motion Curves
	- If acceleration is a polynomial of degree \( n \) in \( t \), then velocity and position are polynomials of degree \( n+1 \) and \( n+2 \), respectively.
- ## Other Graphical Methods
- ### Moment-Area Method
	- Calculates the position of a particle from the \( a \)-\( t \) curve.
	- The integral of the area under the \( v \)-\( t \) curve divided into a rectangle and differential elements provides the position \( x \).
- ### v-x Curve
	- On a \( v \)-\( x \) curve, the acceleration \( a \) can be obtained by drawing a normal to the curve and measuring the subnormal.
	- The subnormal length equals \( a \), following the formula \( a = v \frac{dv}{dx} \).
- ## Applications
	- Graphical methods are especially advantageous for complex or segmented motions and provide an intuitive understanding of motion dynamics.
