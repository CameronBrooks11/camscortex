# Innovations/Technology
- ## Medical/Healthcare
	- Bacteria/protein engineered to clot blood instantly
		- For trauma injuries
	- Clippers that use magnetism to close the blades (for small surgery etc.)
	- Erectile dysfunction device that fits around the base of penis to help increase blood flow (ultrasound? Magnetism or electricity to stimulate the nerves? - would prob depend on physiological basis of the ED)
	- Fully automatic CPR AED device
	- Device to slip over drowning victim's head/mouth and nose to pump water out while swimming back to shore for lifeguarding (also monitors breathing and helps breaths go) - they would have to be face down so any fluid, water, vomit, etc. drains out
	- Someway to make common drugs and insulin affordable
		- Bioreactors? Biohacking
	- At home health monitor/micromanaged healthcare and preventative healthcare (BP, diabetes, organ function, WBC, universal marker that indicates unbalance?, test for STIs, hyper- and hypothyroidism tracker that calculates micro adjustments for that medication doesn’t induce the opposite)
		- Custom vitamin calculator then multivitamin gets sent to u - micromanaged and adjusted
		- [[Blueprint Bryan Johnson]]
	- Electrical, magnetic or wave device that gets rid of pain impulses (are pain stimuli a different voltage or frequency - how does pain and movement transmit at same time? Wouldn’t they overlap?)
	- Electricity to treat infection (instead of or with antibiotics)
	- Device to relieve muscle tension using electricity or magnetism

	- Automatic inventory tracker for hospitals
		- Some type of paint or liquid that’s sustainable and fast drying
		- Every week has a slight different composition of paint that is detected to determine expiry date - do certain products have certain ranges of dates in a batch (e.g. will one batch always be within 2 weeks of expiry date range)
		- Paint comes in dots of equal size (how is it easily applied?)
	- Device that takes on the shape of damaged vessels for trauma (magnets?, fills GSWs?)
	- Exoskeleton that reinforces movements for workers that move and bend a lot - also enforces good form
	- Device that goes along with the at home health thing where the doctor can do basic check up in the person's home without being there

	- Swimming aids that are like puddle jumpers that you can remove foam or deflate bit by bit to help wean swimmers off assists and one that does similar for hands for rocket ship glide (magnets?)
	- LiDAR and biomechanical capture device for working out and sports
		- Advertise via influencer
	- Flex detector motion capture (Dynamicoach) or other applications for small scale high precision flex sensors
- ## Houseware
	- Reusable objects system using photopolymer
		- Bowls, plates, forks, knives, spoons, etc.
			- No need to clean since they are liquified and separated from other molecules
	- Sound blocker around bed
- ## Real Estate/Architecture/Infrastructure
	- Essential living structures (homeless, low-income, etc.)
	- Shipping container home/hotel (easy to move)
	- Windows that use nematic liquid crystals that orient in an external electric field to control translucency (controlled with phone, can be set to be more opaque/translucent based on time)
	- Pool concept where it can be covered with a hard cover that can be stepped on (fake grass?) for small yards
	- Net or other system to be placed in water that doesn’t disrupt ecosystem to save people that fall through ice in winter
	- Sleeping pod that can be set up anywhere - for homeless or outdoorsy stuff (protected from elements, comfortable, secure)
	- Circular economy for building (specifically for SCHs?)
	- Automatic doors that fold in and out and have facial detection
- ## Sustainability
	- Removing microplastics from water (electric field to polarize particles and pull them in?)
	- Using ocean junk as a filler in concrete or as a building material
	- Disposable water bottles like same size and pack size except it’s reusable and the plastic wrap that usually holds it is a hard case that’s top opens and close and contains pipes that lead to one central fill up point (one way valve type thing on lid)
	- Photopolymer as a piece of circular economy
	- Robots that clean ecosystems that biodegrade after
