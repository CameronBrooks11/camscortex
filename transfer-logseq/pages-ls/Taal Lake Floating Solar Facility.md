- # Overview
	- #gpt-gen The Taal Lake Floating Solar Facility is a 1.6 megawatt (MW) solar system located on the surface of Taal Lake in the Philippines. The system is made up of 4,180 solar panels mounted on floating buoys. It is the first of its kind in the country and the largest such facility in Southeast Asia. The installation is expected to generate energy equivalent to the amount consumed by 2,500 households and reduce 1,425 tons of carbon dioxide per year. The project, which began in 2018 and was commissioned in 2019, is estimated to save the local electric company around 6 million pesos ($121,000) in fuel costs annually. In addition, the installation is expected to reduce the need for building large infrastructure, such as dams or power plants, near the lake in order to generate electricity.
