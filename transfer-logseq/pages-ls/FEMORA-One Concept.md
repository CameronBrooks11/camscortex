- Project Aim
	- FEMORA aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient solution for electrolysis processes. By leveraging the principles of millifluidics in a membrane-less system, FEMORA introduces a new paradigm in reactor design that is adaptable to a range of scales and applications.
- Integration with BREAD
	- This project will utilize and adapt existing general BREAD (Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device) slices or develop new, specialized slices as needed. BREAD, a versatile and modular open-source data acquisition and automation framework, offers an ideal foundation for the development and integration of FEMORA components.
	- BREAD Compatibility
		- FEMORA's design and implementation are aligned with the BREAD framework, ensuring seamless compatibility and integration. This allows FEMORA to leverage the broad range of functionalities and modular capabilities offered by BREAD, enhancing its adaptability and scope of application.
