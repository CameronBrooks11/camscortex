- [[Abstract]]
	- Hypochlorous acid (HOCl or HClO) is a weak acid that forms when chlorine dissolves in water, and itself partially dissociates, forming hypochlorite, ClO−. HClO and ClO− are oxidizers, and the primary disinfection agents of chlorine solutions. HClO cannot be isolated from these solutions due to rapid equilibration with its precursor. Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and calcium hypochlorite  (Ca(ClO)2), are bleaches, deodorants, and disinfectants.
	  Hypochlorous acid is found naturally in white blood cells of mammals, including the human body. It is non-toxic and has been used as a safe wound care solution for many years.When dissolved in water, hypochlorous acid water has been found to have strong disinfection properties. Given this and its non-toxicity, it has been identified as a useful cleaning agent and sanitizer. It has been identified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a disinfectant effective against COVID-19, backed by clinical studies.
	  Because of its ability to penetrate pathogens' membranes, it is also used as a commercial deodorizer.
