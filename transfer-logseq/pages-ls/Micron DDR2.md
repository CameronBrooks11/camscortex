- Micron DDR2 refers to a specific type of memory chip manufactured by Micron Technology, Inc., a leading semiconductor company that specializes in memory and storage solutions. DDR2 stands for "Double Data Rate 2," representing the second generation of DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) technology.
  DDR2 SDRAM builds upon its predecessor, DDR SDRAM, by offering several enhancements, such as higher memory densities, lower power consumption, and faster data transfer rates. A key advancement in DDR2 is its ability to achieve twice the data rate of DDR memory by transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. This is facilitated through the use of a differential data strobe (DQS) that enables better control of the data lines during read and write operations.
  DDR2 memory chips also feature a higher [[prefetch buffer]], increased from 2 bits per access in DDR to 4 bits per access in DDR2. This allows for the transfer of more data per memory access, improving overall performance. Furthermore, DDR2 employs a technique called On-Die Termination (ODT) that reduces signal reflections and enhances signal integrity, particularly at higher clock speeds.
  Another significant improvement in DDR2 is the reduction in operating voltage from 2.5V in DDR to 1.8V in DDR2. This lower voltage contributes to reduced power consumption and heat generation, enabling more efficient operation in electronic devices.
  Micron Technology has been at the forefront of memory technology development and manufacturing, playing a pivotal role in producing various generations of DDR SDRAM, including DDR2. Their DDR2 memory chips were widely used in computers, servers, and other electronic devices during the DDR2 era, before being superseded by subsequent generations of DDR memory, such as DDR3 and DDR4.
