		- Initial email from Elizabeth
			- This email serves a few purposes:
			- It provides [the link to the asynchronous Train-the-Trainer preparatory materials](https://how-to-change-the-world-february-2023.notion.site/Train-the-Trainer-preparatory-materials-for-How-to-Change-the-World-Bootcamps-2023-d913fe815af34df3964a01f797d49752).
				- As noted previously, we kindly ask you to take the time – between one and two hours – to **please go through prior to our Train-the-Trainer Workshop on Saturday 18 February 11:00am to 3:00pm ET.**
			- It allows us to introduce you to your Cohort Lead – in this case, Elie – and to each other as the Cohort Teaching Team for the Challenge focusing on [SDG-13 Climate Action in Freiburg, Germany](https://how-to-change-the-world.notion.site/SDG-13-Climate-Action-in-Freiburg-Germany-February-2023-759081e01d104001b8a10a7e3735969d)!
				- Elie will reach out to organise a Cohort Teaching Team meeting over the next couple of weeks *(and before the Train the Trainer session on February 18)* so that you can meet one another and discuss any questions you have about the Bootcamp and/or the Train the Trainer process!
				- *The Challenges will **not** be a focus of the Train-the-Trainer Workshop – though we encourage you to take a few minutes to skim it prior to the Train-the-Trainer Workshop.*
			- It allows us to (re-)confirm the dates and times of the Train-the-Trainer and the Bootcamp program.
				- *Please note that participation is required for all below dates and times. If you anticipate being unavailable, please be sure you email us at *[*feb23@htctw.org *](mailto:feb23@htctw.org)*as soon as possible (unless you have already done so!*)
				- **Train-the-Trainer Workshop:**** Saturday 18 February from 11:00am-3:00pm Eastern Time.**
					- The Train-the-Trainer workshop will be held fully-virtually.
					- Please ensure to review all materials above in advance of this first session.
				- Bootcamp Program: February 20-24, 2023
					- A full agenda of the program, as well as time requirements, for each day can be found in the Train the Trainer materials
					- You will also receive calendar invitations for the program week.
				- As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to [feb23@htctw.org](mailto:feb23@htctw.org) if you have any questions.
