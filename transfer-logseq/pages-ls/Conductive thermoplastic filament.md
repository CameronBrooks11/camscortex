			- John M Thompson Innovation Fund Application
			  Eligibility:  Western Engineering student with tuition paid in full.
			  1. Principle Innovator Name: Cameron Brooks, Email: cbrook49@uwo.ca
			  2. Verify all Western tuition has been paid in full:  YES
			  3. Engineering Department: Electrical and Computer Engineering
			  4. Team: Jessica Kerr, jkerr87@uwo.ca, Mechnical Engineering/Computer Science
			  5. Summary of idea (~100-200 words)
			  Create a thermoplastic polymer that can be made using generic off the shelf materials and open source hardware tools. Conductive thermoplastic filaments are filaments made of a polymer blend that contains electrically-conductive particles, such as metal or graphite. They are used to create printed circuits and objects with embedded electrical components. An open source ball mill will be used to create these conductive particles which will be blended with the polymer and extruded using an open source filament extruder.
			  6. How will you measure success? (~100-200 words)
			  Success will be measured on two main factors: conductivity and printability. 
			  7. For open source projects provide link to documentation (including BOM, CAD, electronic schematics, software and OS license) or OSHWA certification #:
			  8. For proprietary projects â€“ link to provisional patent or application #:
			  9. Value of funds requested: $______________
			  10. Use of funds. Attach a bill of materials including component, number, cost and source url and/or processing quotes.
			  By sending this application you agree to use the funds for the stated purpose and report back to the Thompson Centre on outcomes if successfully awarded funding.
			  Email completed forms and supporting cost information to: joshua.pearce@uwo.ca

	- Explain what a conductive thermoplastic filament for 3D printing is.
		- Conductive thermoplastic filaments are filaments used in 3D printing that are capable of carrying an electrical current. These filaments are made of a polymer blend that contains electrically-conductive particles, such as metal or graphite. They are used to create printed circuits and objects with embedded electrical components. The addition of the conductive particles allows electrical current to pass through the 3D printed objects, enabling the printing of antennas, sensors and wearable electronics.
