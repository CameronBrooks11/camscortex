- [[Abstract]]
	- Real-time Earth imaging has been shown to make a tangible diﬀerence in the eﬃcacy of emergency relief operations. During a disaster, the environment itself is rapidly changing and being able to understand the current landscape is essential for any relief eﬀorts. Data from current Earth observation satellites can only be retrieved through conventional communication infrastructure such as ground stations, radio towers and data lines which may fail during an emergency. Traditionally disaster relief eﬀorts have relied on Amateur Radio Operators (AROs) to continue the ﬂow of information in these situations. However, they can only transmit data that is available to them which has historically not included satellite imagery data. To address this shortcoming, we designed ALEASAT, a 1U Earth-imaging CubeSat, that will provide on-demand satellite imagery directly to AROs. An ARO will be able to send a request with a set of coordinates to the ALEASAT team, who will approve the request and provide the ARO with an authentication key to allow direct communication with ALEASAT. During the next available pass, ALEASAT will capture the image and the ARO can retrieve it directly from the satellite.
