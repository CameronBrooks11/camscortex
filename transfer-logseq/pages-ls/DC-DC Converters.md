- ## What is a DC-DC Converter?
	- A DC-to-DC converter is an [[electronic circuit]] or [[electromechanical device]] that converts a source of direct current (DC) from one voltage level to another
		- It is a type of [[electric power converter]].
	- Power levels range from very low (small batteries) to very high (high-voltage power transmission).
	- They can [[step-up]], [[step-down]], and [[invert]].
- ## Theory of Operation
	- Practical electronic converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC voltage level to another, which may be higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components ([[inductors]], [[transformers]]) or electric field storage components ([[capacitors]]). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is often more power-efficient (typical efficiency is 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat.
	- The [[power switch]] was the key to practical switching regulators, namely the [[Vertical Metal Oxide Semiconductor (VMOS)]] power switch, switching supplies were generally not practical.
- The inductor's main function is to limit the current [[slew rate]] through the power switch.
	- This action limits the otherwise high-peak current that would be limited by the switch resistance alone.
	- The key advantage for using an inductor in switching regulators is that an inductor stores energy. This energy can be expressed in Joules as a function of the current by:
		- E = ½ × L × I²
	- The current is 90 degrees out of phase with the voltage. Because of this, the energy is stored and can be recovered in the discharge phase of the switching cycle
- A [[switching regulator]] is a circuit that uses a power switch, an inductor, and a diode to transfer energy from input to output.
	- The basic components of the switching circuit can be rearranged to form a step-down (buck) converter, a step-up (boost) converter, or an inverter (flyback).
	- These designs are shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, where Figures 3 and 4 are the same except for the transformer and the diode polarity.

- ### Charge Phase
	- A basic boost configuration is depicted in Figure 5.

	- Assume the switch has been open for a long time:
		- The voltage drop across the diode is negative
		- The voltage across the capacitor is equal to the input voltage
	- When the switch closes, the input voltage, +V_{IN}, is impressed across the inductor and the diode prevents the capacitor from discharging +V_{OUT} to ground.
		- Because the input voltage is DC, current through the inductor rises linearly with time at a rate proportional to the input voltage divided by the inductance.
- ### Discharge Phase
	- Figure 6 shows the discharge phase.

	- When the switch opens again, the inductor current continues to flow into the [[rectification diode]] to charge the output. As the output voltage  rises, the slope of the current, di/dt, though the inductor reverses. The output voltage rises until equilibrium is reached or:
		- V_{L} = L * di/dt
			- In other words, the higher the inductor voltage, the faster the inductor current drops.
		- In a steady-state operating condition, the average voltage across the inductor over the entire switching cycle is zero.
			- This implies that the average current through the inductor is also in steady state.
				- This is an important rule governing all inductor-based switching topologies.
		- Furthermore, we can establish that for a given charge time (switch closed), t_{ON}, and a given input voltage and with the circuit in equilibrium, there is a specific discharge time (switch open), t_{OFF}, for an output voltage.
		- During the charge period t_{ON} the voltage across the inductor V_{L,ON} is equal to the input voltage, V_{IN}.
			- Because the average inductor voltage in steady state must equal zero, we can calculate for the boost circuit:
				- V_{L,ON} * t_{ON} = V_{L,OFF} * t_{OFF}
					- When we substitute V_{IN} for V_{L,ON} we get:
				- V_{IN} * t_{ON} = V_{L,OFF} * t_{OFF}
					- Since V_{OUT} = V_{IN} + V_{L}, we get:
				- V_{OUT} = V_{IN} * (1+t_{ON}/t_{OFF})
					- The relationship for duty cycle is given by: D = t_{ON}/(t_{ON} + t_{OFF})
				- V_{OUT} = V_{IN}/(1-D) is the relationship for the boost configuration
			- A similar derivation can be applied for the buck configuration:
				- V_{OUT} = V_{IN}*D
			- A similar derivation can be applied for the inverter (flyback) configuration:
				- V_{OUT} = V_{IN}*D/(1-D)
- ## Advantages and Disadvantages
- ### Advantages
	- Switching regulators offer three main advantages compared to linear regulators:
		- Switching efficiency can be much better.
		- Because less energy is lost in the transfer, smaller components and less thermal management are required.
		- The energy stored by an inductor in a switching regulator can be transformed to output voltages that can be greater than the input (boost), negative (inverter), or can even be transferred through a transformer to provide electrical isolation with respect to the input (Figure 4).
- ### Disadvantages
	- They can be noisy.
	- Require energy management in the form of a control loop.
		- Fortunately, the solution to these control problems is integrated in modern switching-mode controller chips.
