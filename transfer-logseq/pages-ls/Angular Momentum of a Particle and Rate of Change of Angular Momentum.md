# Angular Momentum of a Particle and Rate of Change of Angular Momentum
- **Concept of Angular Momentum**
  collapsed:: true
	- Angular momentum (\( H_O \)) of a particle is the moment of its linear momentum (\( mv \)) about a point O.
	- It is a vector quantity, perpendicular to the plane containing the position vector \( r \) and linear momentum \( mv \).
- **Mathematical Representation**
	- Expressed as \( H_O = r \times mv \).
	- Magnitude given by \( H_O = rmv \sin \phi \), where \( \phi \) is the angle between \( r \) and \( mv \).
	- Angular momentum units: kg mÂ²/s in SI, ft lb s in U.S. customary units.
- **Component Calculation**
	- Components of \( H_O \) represent the moments of linear momentum about coordinate axes.
	- For a particle in the xy plane (\( z = vz = 0 \)), only the z-component of angular momentum is non-zero: \( H_O = H_z = m(xv_y - yv_x) \).
- **Angular Momentum in Polar Coordinates**
	- For motion in polar coordinates, angular momentum can be expressed as \( H_O = mr^2\dot{\theta} \), with \( \dot{\theta} \) being the angular velocity.
- **Rate of Change of Angular Momentum**
	- Differentiating \( H_O \) gives the rate of change of angular momentum (\( \dot{H}_O \)).
	- By Newton's second law, this equals the sum of moments (\( \Sigma M_O \)) of the forces about O: \( \Sigma M_O = \dot{H}_O \).
	- This principle connects the dynamics of rotational motion to the forces acting on a particle.
- **Applications and Significance**
	- Understanding angular momentum is crucial in fields like [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Astronomy]], and [[Physics]].
	- It is instrumental in analyzing rotational motion, stability, and dynamics of particles and rigid bodies.
- **Analytical Tools**
	- Angular momentum and its rate of change provide powerful tools for solving problems in rotational kinematics and kinetics.
	- They offer insights into the effects of forces and torques on rotational motion.
