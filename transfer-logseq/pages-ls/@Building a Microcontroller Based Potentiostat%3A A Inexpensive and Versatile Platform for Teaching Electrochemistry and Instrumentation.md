- [[Abstract]]
	- A versatile potentiostat based on inexpensive and “off the shelf” components is reported. The platform was shown to be capable of performing simple electrochemistry experiments, suitable for undergraduate level teaching. The simple design and construction enable easy customization to accommodate a broad array of experimental designs. The equipment was used to calculate the diffusion coefficient of potassium ferricyanide in an aqueous solution, and the obtained result was in good agreement with the literature. Although simple in design, the low cost and good performance of the device make it a competitive alternative for teaching laboratories in the fields of both electronics and electrochemistry, and for developing teaching centers that cannot afford a commercial device.
