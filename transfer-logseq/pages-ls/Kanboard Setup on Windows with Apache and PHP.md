# Kanboard Setup on Windows with Apache and PHP
- ## Prerequisites
	- Ensure you have Apache and PHP installed:
		- [[Apache and PHP Setup on Windows]]
	- Verify your server configuration adheres to Kanboard's requirements:
		- Protect the `data` directory from public URL access.
		- Enable `.htaccess` in Apache (`AllowOverride All`).
- ## Installation Steps
	- ### From the Archive (Stable Version)
	  1. **Download Kanboard**
		- Download the stable version of Kanboard from their [official website](https://kanboard.org/).
	- 2. **Upload Kanboard to Your Server**
		- Copy the Kanboard directory to your desired location on the server. For example, to `C:\Apache24\htdocs\kanboard`.
	- 3. **Check Directory Permissions**
		- Ensure the `data` directory within the Kanboard folder is writable by the web server user.
	- 4. **Configure Apache (if not already done)**
		- Edit the Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf`) to enable `.htaccess`:
			- Find the `<Directory>` section corresponding to your server's root (e.g., `C:\Apache24\htdocs`).
			- Change `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All`.
		- Restart Apache to apply changes: `httpd.exe -k restart`.
	- 5. **Access Kanboard**
		- Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost/kanboard`.
		- Log in with the default credentials: **Username:** `admin` **Password:** `admin`.
	- 6. **Change Default Credentials**
		- For security, change the default username and password immediately.
	- ### From the Git Repository (Development Version)
	  1. **Clone the Repository**
		- Use Git to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard.git`.
		- Follow the steps from the third point in the above section.
- ## Post-Installation
	- **Data Folder Usage**
		- Understand that the `data` folder is used to store:
			- SQLite database (`db.sqlite`).
			- Debug file (`debug.log`) if debug mode is enabled.
			- Uploaded files (`files/*`).
			- Image thumbnails (`files/thumbnails/*`).
	- **Remote Database and Object Storage**
		- Users with a remote database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) and object storage (AWS S3) might not require a persistent local `data` folder.
- ## Note
	- Using the Git repository method will install the *current development version of Kanboard*, which **might be unstable**.
	- ***Use at your own risk***.
