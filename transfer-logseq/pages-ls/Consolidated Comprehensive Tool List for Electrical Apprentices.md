- **Note:** The employer will provide all power tools, specialty electrical equipment, and personal protective equipment, but the apprentice is responsible for providing their own hand tools. It's also recommended that the apprentice gradually purchases these tools, prioritizing them based on the immediate needs and financial capability. High-quality tools are an investment in safety and efficacy on the job. Apprentices should consult with experienced workers or mentors to determine the best brands and specific models to purchase.
