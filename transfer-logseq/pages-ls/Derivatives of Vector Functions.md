## Definition of Vector Function Derivative
	- A vector function \( P(u) \) is a function of a scalar variable \( u \) defining the vector's magnitude and direction.
	- The derivative of \( P(u) \) is defined as \( \frac{dP}{du} = \lim_{\Delta u \to 0} \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta u} \), where \( \Delta P = P(u + \Delta u) - P(u) \).
	- The derivative \( \frac{dP}{du} \) is tangent to the curve described by the vector \( P(u) \).
- ## Differentiation Rules for Vector Functions
	- **Sum of Vector Functions:** For \( P(u) + Q(u) \), the derivative is \( \frac{d(P + Q)}{du} = \frac{dP}{du} + \frac{dQ}{du} \).
	- **Scalar and Vector Product:** For a scalar function \( f(u) \) and a vector function \( P(u) \), the derivative of \( fP \) is \( \frac{d(fP)}{du} = \frac{df}{du}P + f\frac{dP}{du} \).
	- **Scalar Product of Two Vectors:** \( \frac{d(P \cdot Q)}{du} = \frac{dP}{du} \cdot Q + P \cdot \frac{dQ}{du} \).
	- **Vector Product of Two Vectors:** \( \frac{d(P \times Q)}{du} = \frac{dP}{du} \times Q + P \times \frac{dQ}{du} \).
- ## Rectangular Components of Vector Derivative
	- A vector \( P \) can be resolved into components along fixed axes: \( P = P_x\mathbf{i} + P_y\mathbf{j} + P_z\mathbf{k} \).
	- The derivative of \( P \) is \( \frac{dP}{du} = \frac{dP_x}{du}\mathbf{i} + \frac{dP_y}{du}\mathbf{j} + \frac{dP_z}{du}\mathbf{k} \).
- ## Rate of Change of a Vector
	- When \( P \) is a function of time \( t \), \( \frac{dP}{dt} \) represents the rate of change of \( P \) with respect to the reference frame.
	- In a moving frame in translation, with axes parallel to a fixed frame, the rate of change of \( P \) is the same in both frames.
- ## Application
	- These principles are essential for understanding the motion of particles in curvilinear paths and analyzing forces and velocities in various physical contexts.
