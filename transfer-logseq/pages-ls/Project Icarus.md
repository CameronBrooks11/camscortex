- I've had a lot of [[Possible Plans for My Masters]], and this page serves as the shaping up an idea I had
  id:: 659f79c0-a686-4d7f-8566-2731c02a72f1
	- [[OpenSCAD AI Idea Outline]]
	- [[OpenSCAD Master Repo Idea Outline]] --> related to [[GSoC 2024 Project Planning: Simple Library Manager]]
- ## Overall Goal / Objective Scratch
	- Improved capturing, retention and flow of open hardware data between atoms and bits.
	- Consolodating? --> database
	- note to cam: remember principles of [design], [[build, modify, and distribute]]
	- "The computer was the death of the analytical engineer"
		- Human-readable described digital designs preserve design intent much better (e.g. scripted CAD)
		- Lighter --> user renders it on their device since there is no need for specialized software
	- High-level outline
		- Review the open source
			- Licensing
			- Parts of The Free and Open Source
				- [things that are open source fully]
				- vitamins
				- block boxes
				- binary blobs (source available)
		- Refine the source
			- Tries to essentially "crack" or convert a design back into one which can be edited with an interpretable open source design [language description]
		-
- ## Features Scratch
	- Online user friendly CAD viewer and editor
		- They can edit constraints specified my author
			- Or they can download the file and open it in an actual CAD program
		- Video/sequence program showing the steps to building OS devices
