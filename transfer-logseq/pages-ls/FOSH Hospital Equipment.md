- **FOSH Hospital Equipment**
	- [[FOSH]], or [[Free and Open Source Hardware]], in the context of [[hospital equipment]], refers to [[medical devices]] and tools whose designs are openly shared, allowing anyone to [[build, modify, and distribute]] them.
	- The concept emphasizes accessibility, affordability, and [[community-driven innovation]], particularly valuable in [[resource-limited settings]].
	- Initial focus on simpler, yet essential, devices allows for [[gradual development]] and testing before moving to more [[complex]] machinery.
	- Some examples of reasonable FOSH hospital equipment for the open source research and medical community to approach:
		- [[Electro surgical unit]]: A device used in surgery to cut tissue or seal blood vessels using high-frequency electrical currents.
		- [[Video laryngoscope]]: A tool for visualizing a patient's airway during intubation, with a camera at the end for better guidance and training.
		- [[Defibrillator]]: A life-saving device that delivers a dose of electric current to the heart to treat life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.
		- [[Patient monitor]]: Equipment for monitoring a patientâ€™s vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
		- [[Sterilizer/autoclave]]: Used for sterilizing equipment, essential for infection control in any medical setting.
		- [[ECG machine]]: Records the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, useful in diagnosing heart conditions.
		- [[Ultrasound machine]]: Uses high-frequency sound waves to visualize internal organs, beneficial in diagnostics and guided procedures.
	- Future expansion into more complex devices can leverage insights gained from the initial simpler projects. This approach supports the evolution of FOSH in healthcare, potentially transforming how medical equipment is accessed and used globally.
