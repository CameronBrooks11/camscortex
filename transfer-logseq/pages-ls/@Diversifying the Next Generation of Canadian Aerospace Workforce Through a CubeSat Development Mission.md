- [[Abstract]]
	- CubeSat development missions have provided many students with a relatively affordable opportunity to get involved in tangible aerospace projects that expand the scope of STEM knowledge for youth in Canada. These projects, however, primarily rely on the knowledge of engineering students, with little emphasis on non-technical aspects of the development cycle, education, and senior member retention. At Simon Fraser University (SFU) Satellite Design Team, we have changed this traditionally technical approach by creating key non-technical team roles to grow members from various faculties, encouraging role-exploration, publicizing key development documentation, and by providing a unique educational program to effectively equip all members with the technical knowledge and team leadership skills to be successful in these projects. We have grown our team to succeed in the key areas of technical development. During this process, non-technical members have found opportunities to obtain critical technical skills through student-run workshops tailored to a non-technical audience. They have also been able to build connections with companies in the aerospace industry, preparing them for their careers ahead. Both technical and non-technical members have been able to join the aerospace industry, drawing on SFU Satellite Design as key qualifying experience.A key area to note is that SFU does not offer any formal aerospace-related education, so our members are primarily self-taught. Despite this, our team has seen rapid holistic growth in our CubeSat development team using this strategy since 2016, and we are confident that this unique strategy can see success in other institutions around the world.
