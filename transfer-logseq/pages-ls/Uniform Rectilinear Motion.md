## Definition
	- Uniform rectilinear motion refers to straight-line motion where the acceleration \( a \) of the particle is zero at all times \( t \).
- ## Characteristics
	- Since acceleration \( a \) is zero, velocity \( v \) remains constant throughout the motion.
	- The equation \( \frac{dx}{dt} = v = \text{constant} \) describes this motion.
- ## Determination of Position
	- The position coordinate \( x \) is derived by integrating the velocity equation.
	- If \( x_0 \) is the initial position, the integration leads to the formula \( x = x_0 + vt \).
	- This equation is applicable only when the particle's velocity is known to be constant.
- ## Practical Applications
	- Uniform rectilinear motion is common in various practical scenarios where acceleration is absent or negligible.
