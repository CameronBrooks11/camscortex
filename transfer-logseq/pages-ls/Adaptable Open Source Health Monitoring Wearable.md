# Concept: Adaptable Open Source Health Monitoring Wearables
- **Overview**
	- Health monitoring wearables are evolving beyond traditional designs like wristbands to more innovative forms like rings.
	- The shift towards flexible, adaptable designs reflects a growing demand for personalized health tracking solutions.
- **Potential Forms**
	- **Rings**: Compact and discreet, offering continuous health data tracking. Example: [[Oura Ring]](https://ouraring.com).
	- **Wristbands**: More space for sensors and potentially more features, but less discreet than rings.
	- **Other Forms**: Innovations may lead to new wearable types, such as smart fabrics or implantable devices.
- **Key Features**
	- **Flexibility**: Both in design (to suit different wearables) and functionality (adaptable to user needs).
	- **Open Source**: Allows for community-driven development and customization.
	- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of vital health metrics.
- **Benefits**
	- **Personalization**: Adapts to individual health needs and preferences.
	- **Innovation**: Open source approach fosters innovation and rapid development.
	- **Accessibility**: Potential for wider accessibility due to diverse form factors.
- **Challenges**
	- **Technical Complexity**: Balancing compact design with advanced features.
	- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensuring user data is protected.
	- **Market Acceptance**: Competing with established commercial products.
