- Evergreen note-taking is a technique that emphasizes creating notes that are long-lasting, constantly evolving, and highly interlinked, like a personal wiki. Here's how to apply this technique using Logseq, a local-first, non-linear, outliner note-taking application that is designed for organizing and sharing personal knowledge.
- **Setting Up Your Evergreen Notes in Logseq:**
	- **Choosing Categories:** Start by creating broad categories to sort your notes. This may include your research and engineering fields like electrical engineering, sustainable development, space, etc. You can also create categories for hobbies, ideas, projects, etc. Use Logseq's page functionality for creating these category pages.
	- **Creating Evergreen Notes:** Start making your evergreen notes. Keep each note atomic; it should contain one idea or concept only. The note's title should ideally reflect its content, so it's easy to recall and link later. In Logseq, you can make new notes by creating a new page.
	- **Linking Notes:** This is the key feature of the evergreen note system. Every time you write a note, look for opportunities to link it to other notes. Logseq's bi-directional linking is invaluable here. To create a link, use double brackets `[[link]]` around the title of the note you want to link.
	- **Regularly Refactoring Notes:** Your evergreen notes should evolve over time. Regularly review your notes to correct, expand, split, or link them. Logseq has a slider mechanism that allows you to see a note and its linked notes side by side. Use it to compare notes and find refactoring opportunities.
	- **Organization Techniques for Evergreen Notes in Logseq:**
	- **Hierarchy of Notes:** While evergreen notes should ideally be non-hierarchical, you can create a rough hierarchy using Logseq's block nesting functionality. For instance, a broad category like 'Electrical Engineering' can have nested blocks like 'Circuit Theory', 'Power Electronics', etc.
	- **Tagging:** Use tags for themes that cut across different categories. For instance, a tag `#sustainability` can link notes from categories like 'Electrical Engineering', 'Manufacturing', etc. To tag, use a hashtag `#` followed by your tag name.
	- **Tables and Graph View:** Use Logseq's tables for structured data and comparisons. Graph view can be used to visually explore your notes. It displays your notes as nodes and links as edges, allowing you to see your knowledge structure.
	- **Daily Notes:** Use Logseq's daily notes feature to capture fleeting notes. These are thoughts or ideas that are not yet mature to be evergreen notes. You can revisit and convert them into evergreen notes later.
	- **Templates:** If you have a particular structure you want to follow for certain notes, create a template. Logseq supports custom templates that you can use every time you create a note in a specific category.
- **Best Practices for Evergreen Notes in Logseq:**
	- **Consistent Naming:** Try to use consistent terms and phrases in note titles to make linking easier.
	- **Regular Review:** Set a schedule to review your evergreen notes regularly.
	- **Embrace Evolvement:** Let your notes and their organization evolve as your understanding evolves.
	- **Atomicity:** Keep your notes atomic. If a note is getting too long, consider breaking it into multiple linked notes.
	- **Avoid Dead-End Notes:** Make sure every note has at least one link to another note.
	- **Curate, Don't Collect:** Evergreen note-taking is not about collecting information, but about curating and developing your understanding. Always rewrite information in your own words.
	- Remember, the exact structure and organization of your evergreen notes will evolve over time as you continue to use Logseq and refine your understanding of the evergreen note-taking system.
