- Earth:
	- In electrical systems, "earth" refers to the grounding of electrical equipment to the Earth's surface.
	- It provides a safe path for electric current to flow into the ground, preventing the buildup of dangerous voltages and reducing the risk of electric shock.
- Protective Earth:
	- Also known as "protective earth (PE) conductor," it is a specific conductor that connects metal parts of electrical appliances or devices to the earth.
	- It safeguards against electric shock by diverting fault currents through the protective earth conductor rather than through the user or other conductive parts.
	- The protective earth conductor is typically colored green or green with yellow stripes in electrical wiring.
- Clean Earth:
	- In power quality and grounding practices, a "clean earth" refers to an earth connection with low impedance and minimal electrical noise or interference.
	- It ensures proper operation of sensitive electronic equipment by minimizing disturbances caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).
	- Techniques such as low-resistance grounding electrodes and shielding against external noise sources are used to establish a clean earth connection.
