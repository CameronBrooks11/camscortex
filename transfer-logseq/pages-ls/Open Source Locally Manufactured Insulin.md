# Open Source Locally Manufactured Insulin (OSLMI)
- **Concept:** The concept of Open Source Locally Manufactured Insulin centers on a [[decentralized]], [[community-driven approach]] to insulin production. Key aspects include:
	- **Developing and Sharing Open-Source Methodologies**: Crafting [[open-source protocols]] for insulin production, allowing for implementation on a [[local scale]]. This is aimed at [[reducing dependence]] on major pharmaceutical companies.
	- **Affordability and Accessibility**: The main goal is to make insulin more [[affordable and accessible]], especially in [[underserved]] or [[economically disadvantaged areas]].
	- **Community Involvement**: Involves significant [[community participation]] in the production process, ensuring that the needs of the local population are met.
	- **Decentralization**: By decentralizing insulin production, the project aims to disrupt the traditional pharmaceutical model, providing a more [[equitable distribution]] of this essential medication.
- This approach not only addresses the issue of insulin affordability but also empowers communities by fostering [[local manufacturing capabilities]] and promoting [[self-sufficiency]] in healthcare.
