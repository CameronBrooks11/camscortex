# Technique 1
	- Preparation
		- Clean Surfaces: Begin by cleaning both PETG surfaces with soap and water to remove any grease, dirt, or debris. Dry thoroughly.
		- Sanding: Use medium-grit sandpaper (around 120-200 grit) to roughen the surfaces to be joined. This increases the adhesive surface area. Follow up with a finer grit (around 400 grit) for a smoother finish that still allows for good glue adhesion.
		- Final Cleaning: Brush off or air blast any sanding residue. Then, wipe both surfaces with a cloth lightly moistened with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove the finest dust particles and any residual oils. Allow the IPA to evaporate completely, leaving the surfaces dry and clean.
	- Gluing (Cyanoacrylate)
		- Apply Super Glue: Apply a thin layer of super glue to one of the prepared surfaces. Ensure the application is even and covers the necessary area for bonding.
		- Joining Surfaces: Carefully align and press the two surfaces together. Apply firm, even pressure to ensure full contact and remove any air bubbles that might weaken the bond.
	- Curing
		- Initial Set: Super glue sets quickly, often within seconds to minutes, but it's essential to allow the bond to cure fully for maximum strength. Avoid moving or stressing the joint for several hours.
		- Full Cure Time: Allow the glue to cure as per the manufacturer's recommended time, typically 24 hours, before subjecting the bond to any significant force or stress.
	- Seam Removal
		- Managing Excess Glue: Use any glue that squeezes out during bonding to fill gaps along the seam. If needed, add a small amount of extra glue to ensure the seam is fully filled.
		- Sanding for a Seamless Finish: After the glue has fully cured, start sanding the seam with fine-grit sandpaper. Begin with a coarse enough grit to remove excess glue and progress to finer grits to seamlessly blend the seam into the surrounding material.
		- Final Touches: Polish the sanded area with even finer grit sandpaper or a plastic polish to restore the PETG surface's clarity or gloss.
