## Key Concepts
- ### Net Benefit and Payback
	- **Net Benefit**: Indicates the future financial benefit of an investment.
	- **Payback**: Measures the time to recover the initial investment.
- ### Time Value of Money
	- Money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.
	- This concept is essential in investment decisions.
- ### Net Present Value (NPV)
	- Compares the value of a dollar today to its future value.
	- NPV involves calculating the difference between present value of cash inflows and outflows.
- ### Interest Types
	- **Simple Interest**: Interest is paid only on the principal.
	- **Compound Interest**: Interest is earned on both the principal and the previously earned interest.
- ### Investment Analysis
	- Involves examining initial cash outflows followed by a series of inflows and outflows.
	- Future cash flows are discounted to present values.
- ### Cash Flow Diagrams
	- Visual representation of cash inflows and outflows over time.
	- Includes initial cost, salvage value, maintenance/operating cost, and monetary gains.
- ### Evaluating Investments Using NPV
	- An investment is good if NPV > 0 and bad if NPV < 0.
	- Financial equivalence is when different cash flow profiles have the same NPV.
- ### Annuities
	- A series of equal cash flows over a specified period.
	- Used to calculate present value of recurring cash flows.
- ### Relevant Cash Flows
	- Focuses on cash flows that differ as a result of the investment decision.
	- Known as differential analysis.
- ### Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR)
	- The minimum rate of return a company is willing to accept before selecting a project.
	- Depends on cost of capital, opportunity costs, and risk of the investment.
- ### Cost of Capital & Risk
	- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Combination of debt, equity, and profit.
	- The riskier the project, the higher the MARR.
- ### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
	- The discount rate at which NPV of cash flows equals zero.
	- Used to determine investment feasibility.
- ### External Rate of Return (ERR)
	- Reflects the future value of re-invested cash flows generated by an investment.
	- Used to assess investment feasibility.
- ### Renewable Investments
	- Investments like tools and equipment that wear down over time.
	- Includes maintenance costs, salvage values, and evaluation of different life spans.
- ### Equivalent Annual Cash Flows
	- Used to compare NPV of investments with different life spans.
	- Represents the equivalent annual cost for a project.
- ### Depreciation & Taxes in NPV Analysis
	- Taxes are considered real cash flows in NPV analysis.
	- Depreciation is not a cash flow but affects taxes.
- ### Public Sector Decision Making
	- Involves balancing financial considerations with societal needs and benefits.
	- Includes evaluating benefits, disbenefits, revenues, and costs of public projects.
- ### Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) in Public Sector
	- A ratio used in cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the financial viability of public sector projects.
	- Indicates a good investment if BCR > 1 and a bad one if BCR < 1.
