			- Why do you think the New Engineering Building is an important investment for students at Western University?
				- The New Engineering Building is an important investment for the engineering student society at Western University because it will provide the students with a modern, state-of-the-art facility to learn, innovate, and develop their skills. It will also provide the necessary space to accommodate a growing student population, as well as provide appropriate spaces for specialized classes, research, and project work. Additionally, the building has the potential to foster collaboration, allow for team-work, and bring people together for meaningful collaborative projects. Finally, the new space will help to promote a greater sense of community within the engineering student society.
			- How do you plan on engaging students to help them better understand the New Engineering Building that is very low effort?
				- 1. Make a fun video featuring current students sharing their experiences in the building, such as interesting stories and activities that have taken place there.
				  
				  2. Post interactive polls or quizzes on social media asking students to guess what the building is used for or what kinds of technologies are featured inside.
				  
				  3. Organize a virtual field trip event where students can explore the building via a virtual tour with a faculty member.
				  
				  4. Create a game or competition where students compete to win prizes by presenting a design or prototype they created using the building's resources.
				  
				  5. Utilize virtual reality technology to create a “virtual tour” of the building that students can explore from the comfort of their own homes.
			- come up with a pun about the new engineering building
				- This engineering building is really cutting edge—it's the sharpest tool in the shed!
				- You can say it's a "ground-breaking" addition to the campus!

			- Why do you think the New Engineering Building is an important investment?
				- The New Engineering Building is an important investment for the UES and Western Engineering students as a whole because it provides us with a modern, state-of-the-art facility to learn, innovate, and develop our skills. It will also provide the necessary space to accommodate our *rapidly* growing student population, as well as provide appropriate spaces for specialized classes, research, and project work. Additionally, the building has the potential to foster collaboration, allow for team-work, and bring people together for meaningful, student-lead projects. I believe that providing students better access to shops, laboratories, and prototyping spaces allows more students to take advantage of experiential learning opportunities such as build teams, competitions, and the Thompson Grant. Finally, the new space will help to promote a greater sense of community within the engineering community and between the student body and the UES.
			- How do you plan on engaging students to help them better understand the New Engineering Building?
				- 1. If possible show them some kind of render of what it will look like. Seeing it will excite people a lot more than a bunch of words and students want to see where this money is even going.
				  2. Post polls or quizzes on social media asking students to pick which things that want to see in the new building. This will get them thinking more about what they want to see which makes them more likely to want to vote in support.
				  3. Create a competition where students compete to win prizes and *major bragging rights* by presenting a design, prototype, or idea of something that could be apart of or used in the new building.
			- Pitch a slogan idea for students to vote yes in the referendum
				- This engineering building is really cutting edge—it's the sharpest tool in the shed!
				- **I guess you could say that YOUR VOTE could be truly "ground-breaking".**
