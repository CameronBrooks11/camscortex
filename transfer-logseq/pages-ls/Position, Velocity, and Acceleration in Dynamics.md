# Position, Velocity, and Acceleration
- ## Rectilinear Motion
	- Describes the motion of a particle along a straight line.
	- Position of a particle at time \( t \) is defined by its position coordinate \( x \), measured from a fixed origin.
- ## Position Coordinate
	- The position coordinate \( x \) indicates the particle's location and is positive or negative based on direction from the origin.
	- Examples:
		- \( x = 15 \, m \) (positive direction)
		- \( x' = -22 \, m \) (negative direction)
- ## Motion Description
	- The motion of a particle is known when its position coordinate \( x \) is known for every time \( t \).
	- Motion can be represented by an equation in \( x \) and \( t \) or graphically.
- ## Units of Measurement
	- Position coordinate \( x \) is commonly measured in meters (m) or feet (ft).
	- Time \( t \) is measured in seconds (s).
- ## Velocity
- ### Average Velocity
	- Defined as the displacement \( \Delta x \) over a time interval \( \Delta t \).
	- \( \text{Average velocity} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \).
- ### Instantaneous Velocity
	- Obtained by considering increasingly smaller intervals of \( \Delta t \) and \( \Delta x \).
	- Instantaneous velocity \( v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \).
	- Expressed as the derivative \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \).
	- Velocity is a scalar in rectilinear motion, indicating direction and magnitude.
- ## Acceleration
- ### Average Acceleration
	- Defined as the change in velocity \( \Delta v \) over a time interval \( \Delta t \).
	- \( \text{Average acceleration} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \).
- ### Instantaneous Acceleration
	- Calculated as \( \text{Instantaneous acceleration} = a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \).
	- Expressed as \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \) or \( a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \).
	- Acceleration indicates whether the velocity is increasing or decreasing.
- ### Additional Notes on Acceleration
	- Positive acceleration indicates increasing velocity; could be faster in positive direction or slower in negative direction.
	- Negative acceleration indicates decreasing velocity.
	- Deceleration refers to a decrease in the speed (magnitude of velocity) of the particle.
- ## Alternative Expression for Acceleration
	- Derived by eliminating \( dt \) in the velocity and acceleration equations.
	- \( a = v \frac{dv}{dx} \).
