- Traditional Copper Clad Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) face numerous challenges when it comes to their use in space and aerospace applications:
	- Environmental Stress: Outer space presents harsh conditions. Components are exposed to extreme temperatures, radiation, vacuum, and high levels of mechanical stress during launch.
	- Weight: Weight is always a significant consideration in aerospace applications. Traditional copper-clad PCBs can be heavy, which can be a drawback when every gram counts.
	- Reliability: The failure of a PCB in a space application can lead to mission failure. However, traditional PCBs can be subject to failure due to issues like vibration, thermal stress, and the delamination of the copper cladding.
	- Miniaturization: There's a constant demand for smaller, more capable electronic systems. This increases the complexity of PCB design and makes heat dissipation more challenging.
	- Outgassing: Materials used in spacecraft must not outgas significantly, as this can lead to contamination of sensitive optics and other instruments.
- Technologies developed to overcome these issues include:
	- Material Advancements: Materials like polyimide and PTFE have been used due to their ability to withstand the harsh conditions of space. These materials have higher heat resistance and lower outgassing characteristics than traditional FR-4.
	- Embedded Components: The integration of components within the PCB can increase density and decrease weight.
	- Conformal Coatings: These coatings are applied to completed circuit boards to protect them from environmental stresses such as moisture, dust, and extreme temperature.
	- High Density Interconnect (HDI) PCBs: These offer greater component density and improved electrical performance, accommodating miniaturization and complexity trends.
- Challenges that still persist include:
	- Improved Radiation Hardness: Despite the advancements in materials and design, radiation remains a significant issue. More research is needed to develop materials and designs that are more resistant to radiation.
