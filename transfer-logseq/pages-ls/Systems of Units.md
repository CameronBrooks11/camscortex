# Systems of Units
- **Overview of Systems of Units**
	- Systems of units in [[Physics]] are essential for consistently measuring and calculating physical quantities like force, mass, length, and time.
	- The choice of units impacts the validity of equations like \( F = ma \), necessitating a consistent system of units.
- **International System of Units (SI Units)**
	- SI Units, or Système International d’Unités, is widely used globally.
	- Base units: meter (m) for length, kilogram (kg) for mass, and second (s) for time.
	- Derived unit of force: newton (N), defined as the force that gives an acceleration of 1 m/s² to a mass of 1 kg.
	- SI units are an absolute system, meaning their values are constant and independent of location.
	- Weight in SI: expressed in newtons, calculated as \( W = mg \), where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.
- **U.S. Customary Units**
	- Commonly used by American engineers.
	- Base units: foot (ft) for length, pound (lb) for force, and second (s) for time.
	- Unit of mass: slug, defined as the mass that receives an acceleration of 1 ft/s² when a force of 1 lb is applied.
	- This system is a gravitational system of units, dependent on the earth's gravitational attraction.
	- Weight in U.S. Customary Units: typically expressed in pounds.
- **Conversion between Systems**
	- Conversion is crucial when working with international or diverse sets of data.
	- Basic conversion factors:
		- Length: 1 ft = 0.3048 m.
		- Force: 1 lb = 4.448 N.
		- Mass: 1 slug = 14.59 kg.
- **Importance in Engineering and Physics**
	- Correct use of units is essential in [[Engineering]] and [[Physics]] for accurate measurements and calculations.
	- Misuse of units can lead to significant errors in analysis and design.
- **Linear Momentum in Different Units**
	- Linear momentum \( mv \) can be expressed in both systems:
		- In SI Units: \( mv \) in kg m/s.
		- In U.S. Customary Units: \( mv \) in lb s.
- **Notation and Application**
	- Consistent use of notation and understanding of unit systems is crucial in scientific communication and education.
	- Knowledge of systems of units helps in interpreting and applying scientific and engineering concepts across various disciplines.
