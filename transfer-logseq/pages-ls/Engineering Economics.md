- ## Overview
	- Engineering Economics focuses on assessing [[investment alternatives]] to make optimal decisions.
	- Optimal investment decisions are defined as the most financially feasible.
- ## Core Concepts
- ### Financial Tools in Engineering Economics
	- Utilizes financial tools alongside technical expertise and qualitative considerations.
	- Aims to evaluate investment alternatives that are commonly encountered by engineers.
- ### Common Engineering Economics Decisions
	- Includes equipment selection or replacement, process selection, structural or expansion decisions, new products or product expansion, cost reduction, improving service or quality, and public sector decisions.
- ### Value Proposition
	- To be chosen by customers, a company must provide better value (benefits / cost) than competitors.
	- Engineering Economics plays a crucial role in determining this optimal value.
- ### Goals of Engineering Economics
	- Effectiveness: Better meeting customer needs.
	- Efficiency: Producing at lower costs.
	- Overall goal: Provide more value for less.
- ### Engineering Economics & Operations
	- Many investment decisions involve operational aspects.
	- Engineers play a role in designing, creating, and implementing processes to improve efficiency.
	- Incorporates elements of operations like capacity analysis.
- ## Engineering Economics Framework
- ### Task Analysis
	- Identifying what is important to the customer and whether current operations meet their needs.
	- Involves understanding customer priorities such as quality, quantity, price, service, and specific functions or features.
- ### Process Analysis
	- Focuses on analyzing the process flow and capacity.
	- Identifies bottlenecks and suggests ways for line balancing and capacity optimization.
- ### Trade-Off Analysis
	- Involves comparing costs versus benefits, calculating net present value, and weighing pros versus cons.
	- Key steps include calculating total costs, assessing financial benefits, and considering qualitative aspects.
- ### Decision & Support
	- Involves understanding the problem thoroughly and applying the analysis to solve it.
- ## Implementing Engineering Economics
- ### Task Analysis in Practice
	- Determining customer needs and prioritizing outcomes based on quality, quantity, price, service, and function.
- ### Process Analysis in Practice
	- Utilizing process flow diagrams to visualize and improve the process.
	- Key concepts include theoretical and operating capacity, identifying bottlenecks, and line balancing.
- ### Trade-Off Analysis in Practice
	- Calculating net benefit, understanding relevant costs, incremental benefits, and contribution.
	- Also includes understanding incremental costs and sunk costs.
- ### Making Decisions
	- Combining qualitative and quantitative analysis.
	- Decisions should include upfront decision, recommendations, supports (qualitative and quantitative), evaluation of alternatives, risk analysis, and conclusion.
