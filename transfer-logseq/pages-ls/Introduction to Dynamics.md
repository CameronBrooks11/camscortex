## Overview
	- Dynamics is the study of bodies in motion, as opposed to statics, which focuses on bodies at rest.
	- The field of dynamics was significantly advanced by [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton]], with Newton formulating the fundamental laws of motion.
- ## Key Components of Dynamics
- ### Kinematics
	- Focuses on the geometry of motion.
	- Deals with displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time without considering the cause of motion.
- ### Kinetics
	- Examines the relationship between forces, mass, and the motion of a body.
	- Used to predict motion from known forces or determine required forces for a specific motion.
- ## Dynamics of Particles
- ### General Concept
	- Initially treats bodies (regardless of size) as particles, ignoring rotation about their mass center.
	- Later will explore dynamics of rigid bodies, where rotation is significant.
- ### Rectilinear Motion of a Particle
	- Analyzes position, velocity, and acceleration in straight-line motion.
	- Includes general methods and particular cases like uniform motion and uniformly accelerated motion.
	- Discusses the simultaneous motion of several particles and relative motion concepts.
	- Introduces graphical methods for problem-solving in rectilinear motion.
	- Equations describe the average and instantaneous velocities and accelerations of a particle along a line, where
		- \( \Delta x \) and \( \Delta v \) represent the changes in position and velocity over time interval \( \Delta t \), and \( dx/dt \), \( dv/dt \), and \( d^2x/dt^2 \) represent the first and second derivatives of position with respect to time.
		- \( \text{Average velocity} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \)
		- \( v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \)
		- \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \) (Equation 11.1)
		- \( \text{Average acceleration} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \)
		- \( a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \)
		- \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \) (Equation 11.2)
		- \( a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \) (Equation 11.3)
- ### Curvilinear Motion of a Particle
	- Motion along curved paths, treating position, velocity, and acceleration as vector quantities.
	- Introduces the concept of derivatives of vector functions.
	- Analyzes projectile motion using rectangular components of velocity and acceleration.
	- Examines motion relative to a translating reference frame.
	- Explores tangential, normal, radial, and transverse components of velocity and acceleration.
