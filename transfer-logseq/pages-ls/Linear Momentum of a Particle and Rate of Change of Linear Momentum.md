# Linear Momentum of a Particle and Rate of Change of Linear Momentum
- **Concept of Linear Momentum**
	- Linear momentum, denoted as \( mv \), is a fundamental concept in [[Physics]], particularly in the study of [[Dynamics of Particles]].
	- It is defined as the product of the mass \( m \) of a particle and its velocity \( v \).
	- Linear momentum is a vector quantity, sharing the same direction as the velocity of the particle.
- **Relation to Force**
	- According to Newton's laws, the resultant force \( \Sigma F \) acting on a particle equals the rate of change of its linear momentum.
	- This is mathematically expressed as \( \Sigma F = \frac{d}{dt}(mv) \) or \( \Sigma F = \dot{L} \), where \( L \) represents linear momentum.
- **Historical Context**
	- This formulation of force in terms of the rate of change of momentum is how Newton originally stated his second law of motion.
	- It offers a different perspective on the relationship between force and motion.
- **Conservation Principle**
	- When the resultant force \( \Sigma F \) on a particle is zero, the linear momentum \( mv \) remains constant in both magnitude and direction.
	- This principle is known as the conservation of linear momentum and is akin to Newton's First Law, which states that a particle continues in its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.
- **Limitations**
	- The assumption of constant mass \( m \) is critical in these equations.
	- Situations involving variable mass, such as rockets expelling fuel, require different approaches and are not covered by this principle directly.
- **Newtonian Frame of Reference**
	- The laws of motion, including the concept of linear momentum, assume a Newtonian (or inertial) frame of reference.
	- This frame is ideally one with a constant orientation relative to the distant stars, though for practical purposes, Earth-based frames are often used with negligible error.
- **Application in Mechanics**
	- Understanding linear momentum is crucial for solving problems in [[Mechanics]], particularly those involving collisions, propulsion, and various forms of motion.
	- It forms the basis for more complex concepts in dynamics and is instrumental in fields like [[Engineering]] and [[Astronomy]].
