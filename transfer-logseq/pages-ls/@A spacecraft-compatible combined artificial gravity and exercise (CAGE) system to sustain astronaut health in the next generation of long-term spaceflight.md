- [[Abstract]]
	- Human spaceflight exposes astronauts to prolonged periods of microgravity and high doses of radiation, leading to life-threatening cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurological damage. One of the most dangerous effects of microgravity is the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the intracranial space. The cephalad-fluid shift and muscular atrophy triggered and worsened by microgravity, largely contribute to physiological deconditioning, making medical care for astronauts challenging in many cases. Artificial Gravity (AG) produced by centrifugation may provide an efficient countermeasure against spaceflight physiological deconditioning. The acceleration forces in a centrifuge follow an increasing pattern in the general direction of the upper to lower body, resulting in the creation of AG. Centrifuge-produced AG results in a downward shift of fluid towards the lower body. This downward motion restores fluid balance in the body, lowering the pressure inside the intracranial space and the upper body. Our team at Simon Fraser University's Aerospace Physiology Laboratory has proposed a design for a Combined Artificial Gravity and Exercise (CAGE) device, that would be compatible with the next generation of the commercial spacecrafts and space stations, as well as Lunar bases. CAGE features a customized squat module built at the circumference of the centrifuge apparatus. Squatting activates a full-body workout that allows for an efficient shift of fluid towards the lower body while preventing muscle and bone density loss. Squatting motion will also partially power the rotation of the device, providing a sustainable power source for the apparatus during long-term missions. It is expected that incorporating our proposed CAGE on board of upcoming spacecraft could reduce the current exercise time by approximately half by eliminating the need to transition between devices and maximizing multi-system workouts. The significance of this reduction in scheduled exercise time, besides reducing medical care complications, is the effective time that can be added to running scientific experiments and operational tasks. Along with the maintenance of skeletal, muscle, and cardiovascular systems, active maintenance of fluid balance in the body will enable astronauts to perform long-term space missions with a significantly lower risk of medical complications associated with microgravity. The use of AG combined with exercise in future space missions will be an essential element for interplanetary travel, medical care, and life establishment on other planetary surfaces.
