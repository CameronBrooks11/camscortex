## Position Vector
	- In curvilinear motion, the position of a particle \( P \) is represented by a vector \( \mathbf{r} \) from a fixed origin to \( P \).
	- The position vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is characterized by its magnitude and direction, fully defining the particle's position.
- ## Change in Position Vector
	- The change in position vector over time \( \Delta t \) is represented by \( \Delta \mathbf{r} \), indicating both direction and magnitude change.
- ## Average Velocity
	- Defined as the quotient of \( \Delta \mathbf{r} \) and \( \Delta t \), \( \mathbf{v}_\text{avg} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{r}}{\Delta t} \).
	- Average velocity is a vector in the same direction as \( \Delta \mathbf{r} \) and of magnitude \( \frac{|\Delta \mathbf{r}|}{\Delta t} \).
- ## Instantaneous Velocity
	- As \( \Delta t \) and \( \Delta \mathbf{r} \) become very small, the instantaneous velocity vector \( \mathbf{v} \) is tangent to the particle's path.
	- Represented as \( \mathbf{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \mathbf{r}}{\Delta t} \).
	- It can also be expressed as the derivative of the position vector, \( \mathbf{v} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \).
- ## Speed
	- The magnitude of velocity, or speed \( v \), is the rate of change of arc length \( s \) of the path: \( v = \frac{ds}{dt} \).
- ## Change in Velocity
	- The change in velocity \( \Delta \mathbf{v} \) over time \( \Delta t \) reflects changes in both the direction and magnitude of velocity.
- ## Average Acceleration
	- Defined as the quotient of \( \Delta \mathbf{v} \) and \( \Delta t \), with a vector in the same direction as \( \Delta \mathbf{v} \).
- ## Instantaneous Acceleration
	- Represented as \( \mathbf{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\Delta t} \).
	- It is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, \( \mathbf{a} = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \).
- ## Hodograph
	- The curve described by the tip of the velocity vector \( \mathbf{v} \) when drawn from a fixed origin is called the hodograph.
	- The acceleration vector \( \mathbf{a} \) is generally not tangent to the particle's path but is tangent to the hodograph.
