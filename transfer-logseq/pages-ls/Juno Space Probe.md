- Juno is a NASA space probe that is currently orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was built by Lockheed Martin and is operated by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. [The spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29). Juno’s mission is to measure Jupiter’s composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. [It will also search for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29). [Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29). [Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29).
