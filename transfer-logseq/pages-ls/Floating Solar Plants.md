	- Give some case studies where floating solar plants were used
		- 1. Fort Worth, Texas: In 2018, Oncor temporarily commissioned a 10-MW floating PV array, making it the largest floating solar farm in the US. The project was commissioned for a three-month test run to determine the feasibility of the technology before a broader deployment. 
		  2. [[Taal Lake Floating Solar Facility]] , Philippines: The 2-MW floating solar farm has been installed on the Philippines’ Taal Lake. It is equipped with 6,120 photovoltaic panels with an expected annual output of 3,015 MWh.
		  3. Kasai-sanso Reservoir, Japan: This 7.9-MW project is the world’s largest commercial floating solar farm. It covers an area of 180,000 m2 and is equipped with 36,696 solar panels. It is expected to generate more than 8806MWh of electricity annually.
		  4. Anhui, China: In 2016, China’s first floating solar farm was installed on a lake in eastern Anhui province. The 40-kW PV array is expected to generate more than 50 MWh of electricity per year. 
		  5. Tengeh Reservoir, Singapore: This floating solar farm is the largest in the world; it spans over 600,000 m2. The 50-MW installation is equipped with 166,000 solar panels and is expected to generate around 80,000MWh of electricity per year.
	- Was the Oncor floating solar plant project in Fort Worth, Texas successful?
		- Yes, the Oncor Floating Solar Plant project in Fort Worth, Texas was a success. The project has produced over 1.1 million kWh of energy, enough to power over 400 homes. Oncor expects the plant to produce over 2 million kWh once it is fully operational. The project is a major milestone for the city of Fort Worth and is helping the city reach its renewable energy goals.
	- What are the main advantages and disadvantages of floating solar plants, give references.
		- Advantages:
		  
		  1. Reduced evaporation losses: Floating solar systems help reduce water evaporation losses, as they cover the body of water. They can help preserve the water levels in reservoirs and reduce the need for supplemental irrigation.
		  
		  2. Space efficiency: Floating systems occupy approximately 6 times less space than ground mounted solar systems. This makes them a good choice for sites where space is scarce, such as in urban and suburban areas.
		  
		  3. Reduced risk of land degradation: Ground mounted solar systems require a large amount of land to be set aside for them, and this can lead to issues such as land degradation. Floating systems reduce this risk, as they can be located on existing reservoirs, rivers, lakes, and seas.
		  
		  4. Enhanced performance: Water has a cooling effect on solar PV systems, which can slightly increase their performance. This means they can generate a little more energy than their ground mounted counterparts.
		  
		  5. Cost savings: The cost of solar installation can be reduced thanks to the buoyancy of water. Foundations, which are an expensive part of a solar system, can be eliminated, as floats can be used to support the modules.
		  
		  Disadvantages:
		  1. Reliability: Floating solar systems can be prone to problems related to the environment such as wind and wave action. Bad weather may cause the system to be unstable or even to break apart, which can be a problem for sites with harsh weather conditions.
		  
		  2. Potential for shade: Floating solar systems are more likely to be partially shaded due to nearby objects such as buoys, boats, trees, etc. This can result in decreased system efficiency and higher maintenance costs.
		  
		  3. Maintenance costs: As mentioned above, maintenance costs can be higher for floating systems due to their greater exposure to environmental conditions. They may also suffer from fouling due to the presence of organic matter, algae and other elements which may accumulate on the surface.

	- What are some challenges that floating solar plants face, give references.
		- 1. Limited Space: Generally, only limited spaces such as large water bodies and reservoirs are suitable for floating solar plants. This restricts the potential area to install floating solar plants in space. (https://cleantechnica.com/2019/03/09/common-challenges-faces-by-the-floating-solar-panels/)
		  
		  2. High Water Movement: High-energy water flows and tides can cause floating solar plants to move and become inefficient. To combat this, new anchoring materials have been developed to keep them in place. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-solar-power-plant.asp)
		  
		  3. Maintenance: As the solar panels are placed in a water body, it can be difficult and costly for maintenance if something goes wrong. The floating legs and the mounting structure must be checked regularly for any signs of damage. (https://www.architecturendesign.net/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-floating-solar-plants/)
		  
		  4. Algae and Bird-Related Challenges: Floating solar plants can attract birds and also cause the growth of algae. Both of these can damage the equipment and disrupt the performance of the entire system. (https://www.cleanghana.org/floating-solar-challenges-barriers/)
