- [[Abstract]]
	- Temperature control of systems has become an important subject in all areas around us, especially, in industrial areas at wide range of operating temperature. Another important field is the identification of material characteristics. In this paper, a design of temperature controlled heating system is presented for a tension-compression testing machine. The system involves basically an isolated box, dry resistance, voltage regulator, thermocouple, air fun, microcontroller and computer. The temperature inside the box is controlled by a feedback controller. This feedback control system measures the temperature via a K-type thermocouple and uses a PID controller to compensate the errors. The Arduino board is used as microcontroller because it is cheaper, simpler and easier to programme. In this study, after doing some experiments, the user defined reference temperature profiles are accomplished on the test machine and are compared with that of the mathematical modeling of the heating system.
