- In the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE), an MCU stands for a microcontroller unit. A microcontroller is a small computer on a single integrated circuit that contains a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general-purpose applications. [They are used in automatically controlled products and devices, such as automobile engine control systems, implantable medical devices, remote controls, office machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other embedded systems](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/39589/programming-languages-for-electronics-engineers)[1](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/39589/programming-languages-for-electronics-engineers).
- Microcontrollers are programmed using languages such as C or C++, and there are many high-quality compilers available for these languages. [C is the language of choice for most microcontrollers due to its popularity and the number of compilers available](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/39589/programming-languages-for-electronics-engineers)[1](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/39589/programming-languages-for-electronics-engineers).
