- [[Abstract]]
	- Electrolytic production of hypochlorite in very dilute chloride solutions is investigated using platinum and iridium oxide coated titanium expanded metal electrodes as anodes. The dependence of the hypochlorite production rate on temperature, chloride concentration and current density was determined. It was found that the hypochlorite production rate is consistently higher on iridium oxide coated titanium compared to platinum coated titanium electrodes.
