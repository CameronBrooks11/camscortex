- [[Abstract]]
	- The electrolytic production of hypochlorite from tap water in a flow-through reactor system is investigated using stacked platinum or iridium oxide coated titanium sheet or expanded metal electrodes. The influence of fast chlorine consumption and polarity reversal on the hypochlorite production rate was determined along with the dependence of the hypochlorite production rate on temperature, flow through velocity and current density. It was found that in most cases, the hypochlorite production rate was higher on iridium oxide compared to platinum electrodes. An increase in the flow-through velocity leads to an increased hypochlorite production rate while the hypochlorite production rate falls with increasing temperature.
