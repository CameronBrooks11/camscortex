## Frames of Reference
	- **Fixed Frame:** A frame attached to the Earth or considered stationary.
	- **Moving Frame:** Any frame not rigidly attached to the fixed frame.
- ## Concept of Relative Position
	- Consider two particles A and B moving in space.
	- Vectors \( \mathbf{r}_A \) and \( \mathbf{r}_B \) define their positions relative to a fixed frame \( Oxyz \).
	- A moving frame \( A'x'y'z' \) centered at A, parallel to \( Oxyz \), translates with A.
- ## Position Vector in Moving Frame
	- The vector \( \mathbf{r}_{B/A} \) defines the position of B relative to the moving frame \( A'x'y'z' \) (or simply relative to A).
	- The position vector \( \mathbf{r}_B \) of B is the sum of \( \mathbf{r}_A \) and \( \mathbf{r}_{B/A} \): \( \mathbf{r}_B = \mathbf{r}_A + \mathbf{r}_{B/A} \).
- ## Derivatives in Fixed Frame
	- Differentiating position vector equation: \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_B = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_A + \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{B/A} \).
	- The derivatives represent the velocities \( \mathbf{v}_A \) and \( \mathbf{v}_B \) of A and B, respectively.
	- \( \dot{\mathbf{r}}_{B/A} \) is the velocity \( \mathbf{v}_{B/A} \) of B relative to the moving frame \( A'x'y'z' \) and to the fixed frame.
- ## Velocity and Acceleration Relations
	- Absolute velocity of B: \( \mathbf{v}_B = \mathbf{v}_A + \mathbf{v}_{B/A} \).
	- Absolute acceleration of B: \( \mathbf{a}_B = \mathbf{a}_A + \mathbf{a}_{B/A} \).
- ## Absolute and Relative Motion
	- Absolute motion of B refers to its motion relative to the fixed frame \( Oxyz \).
	- The equations show that absolute motion can be obtained by combining the motion of A and the relative motion of B with respect to A.
	- For translation, the moving frame keeps the same orientation while moving with A.
- ## Application in Rotating Frames
- Different relations are used when dealing with rotating frames, as the orientation of the moving frame changes.
