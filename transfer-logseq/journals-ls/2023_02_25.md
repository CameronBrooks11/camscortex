	- Tried to ` pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio  `
		- But got `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch`
	- Turns out I had to use #[[Python 3.8.6]]
	- Then just set those PATH variables above and restart terminal then retry and it works

	- I scratched all the above and followed [HuggingFace Installation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation) with good results
		- It used a virtual environment instead by calling `python -m venv .env` then `.env/Scripts/activate`
		  collapsed:: true
			- `.env\Scripts\activate.bat` in #cmd or `.env\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in #PowerShell
		- Then proceeded with installation as it said
	- You may have to do `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` as administrator if you get:

	- Hi Tom,
	  It was great to virtually meet and hear your words the other day at HtCtW. What you spoke about really resonated with me and gave me a new perspective since I do research and development in the area of open source hardware tech which promotes distributed manufacturing and sustainable design. On that note I was hoping if you could send me a pdf copy of your book. Thanks again and I have an interest in entrepreneurship and sustainable tech so don't be surprised if you see my name pass your desk someday.
