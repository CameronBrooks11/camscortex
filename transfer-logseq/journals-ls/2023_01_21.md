- First Logseq Journal (attempt 2): Hello World!
- How to use Logseq
	- The hashtag and square backets do the exact same thing
		- Could use hashtag for a topic or concept to reference and square brackets for using a word inline
- I need a page for [[FAST]], [[UG Education]], [[Entrepreneurship]], [[Professional]] , [[Personal Life]]
- In an effort to work on my mental health I'm going to create a node for [[Journaling]]
	- Today was an interesting day. I woke up feeling iffy after having a time and a half at Jordan's place, but I finally really got into Logseq today and I know I am going to LOVE IT. I'm still trying Leaves but I decided on a softer transition for tonight
- It's also crucial that I have a place for all of my [[ideas]]
- DONE populate [[my-plugins]]
