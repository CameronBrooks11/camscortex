- [[Meeting]] with Duke to discuss [[control systems]] for [[Airbrakes Capstone]]
	- Created a simulation based on OpenRocket to add airbrakes
		- Took source code and modifed it to get sims
	- Matrix of flight plan
		- 64x64 matrix at burnout
		- Read current altitude and velocity then select flight plan (velocities and altitutes)
		- PID about that set plan --> just picked 30% and go in and out around that (allows to "speed up" by retracting)
		- Write to serial messed up their stuff?
	- Simulate in anysys
		- Vortex flow around the ends? (Giorgio thinks its fine)
	- Waypoints
		- Flight broken up for altitude vs velocity (we want 0 at 10k)
		- Linearly interpolated to find the linear sections
		- Every data point they had was checked
		- 16 waypoints
	- This year
		- Instead of look up table they do 50% then workbackwards from 10k to select
		- Simulation data + noise
	- Main issue with Kalman filtering is tuning it
	- Add error modes and worst into algo testing
	- Barometer velocity vs IMU velocity
- For [[ISCI3D]] for import to [[PicoGK]] using [kicad-source-mirror/pcbnew/exporters/step/](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-source-mirror/tree/2f6c9d1f3ad4c2b44ec2e9c86b998cdd791648e7/pcbnew/exporters/step)
