- I learned about an awesome concept called [[Evergreen Notes]] created by [[Andy Mathuschak]] which he discusses on [his page](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), but I want to figure out a hybrid system
- Doing my review of the #[[WE Rocketry]] files and info before the meeting
	- Starting with the [[Avionics]] bay design from last year: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U0sG1u7KkjPFnd-g7IlovEylvZDbMEbi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107453609806031730524&rtpof=true&sd=true)
		- The objectives that they had were:
			- Design for assembly
			- Minimize lose cables; have a good cable management method
			- Material for interior and exterior of avionics bay should maximize radio communication and RF signals
		- My add-ons and thoughts include:
			- Design for Assembly: This is very important from my experience since it is often overlooked in favour of other design considerations and it leads to slower [[prototyping]] and reduced flexibility
			- [[Cable Management]]: always good, can be made better with [[3D Printing]]
			- [[Radio Frequency]] Shielding(?): I'm kind of confused about why we want to maximize it since that will protect sensitive electronic components from [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI)
			- [[Thermal Management]]: Needs to be considered
			- [[Environmental Protection]]: Also needs to be considered
			- [[Mounting Hardware]]: Maybe we 3D print the entire [[avionics]] bay with CF-Nylon in small pieces that fit together and are then bolt/fasten together
		- So it has two flight computers: TeleMega and new flight computer (assume AIM XTRA)
			- [Telemega](https://altusmetrum.org/TeleMega/)
				- Summary of the website using [[OpenAssistant]]:
				  collapsed:: true
					- [[TeleMega]] is an open source electronic device serving as a recording altimeter for high power model rockets.
					- Features include support for dual deployment and four additional 
					  [[pyro events]] configurable based on parameters like time and flight 
					  events.
					- Equipped with a 70cm [[HAM Radio]] band transceiver for telemetry downlinks, 
					  barometric pressure sensors, accelerometers, and magnetic sensors.
					- On-board [[GPS]] receiver and non-volatile memory for storing flight data.
					- Can run on a primary LiPo battery or a separate pyro battery up to 12V nominal.
					- Measures 3.25in x 1.25in and fits into a standard 38mm [[airframe coupler tube]].
				- [[TAPR Open Hardware License]] and the [[GNU General Public License Version 2]]
			- [AIM XTRA []AIM XTRA](http://entacore.com/electronics/aimxtra)
				- Summary of the website using [[OpenAssistant]]:
				  collapsed:: true
					- The AIM XTRA GPS flight computer is a powerful and versatile [[telemetry]] system designed for use in [[launch events]].
					- Live Flight Analytics: Provides wideband live GPS flight analytics to optimize tracking experience.
					- Precision Timing Systems: Offers advanced precision timing mechanisms
					- Fault Mitigation: Capable of operating in challenging environments with proprietary adaptive filtering algorithms
					- Applications Range: Suitable for diverse applications such as Unmanned Aircraft vehicles (UAVs), model rocketry etc.
					- Open Source Platform Support: Utilizes open source software platform; supports multi-communication links using XTRALink protocol ensuring compatibility across different platforms.
					- Seamless Integration: Ensures smoother integration and relay accessibility while providing faster response times.
					- Customizability : Provides optimum solutions for different applications.
					- Long battery life with smart cutoffs thanks to openSPRACE framework. Gives best and consistent performance even after prolonged and repetitive operations.
					- Potentially good for longer rebuilt recoveries because "instructions come later."
					- User safety improves with APRS Altitude Cutoff feature protecting owners during mishaps lower than expected threshold. Booster and Multi-Stage rockets usage also supported.
					- Network Expansion Options Available:Integrated FrSky RxVol low-level sensor access and any extension input exposed in SPI header; automates relay modes via VISDM cable adapters keeping setup minimalistic and safer .
					- Configuration Made Easier: Follow simple direction for assembling; accessible trigger pins reduces firmware configuration shenanigans before events.
					- More stable firmware package than competition while setting standard of silence on ground with modules self-healing. Light weight chip packages available regardless of extended functionality compared to competition allowing smaller rockets for longer glide periods. Improved natural frequencies design attenuates shock loads due to impact forces
