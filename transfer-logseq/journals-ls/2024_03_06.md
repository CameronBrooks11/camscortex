	- The plan with the end pieces on the reactor is to have them latch style with a body sleeve that goes over the reactor where either side latches to tight
	- End pieces will also have a cover that contains all the unique geometry to secure things then the end pieces just have holes that the 3D printed cover adapts to which by the latching action is held tight against the seals
		- Use 3D printed molds to create silicone seals as gaskets
	- Possibly use some kind of heater/coolers like [this on sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/heat)
