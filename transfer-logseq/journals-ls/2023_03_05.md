			- [The Moku:Pro by LiquidInstruments is a high-performance, software-defined hardware platform that combines a powerful FPGA with a high-bandwidth analog front-end](https://www.mouser.com/new/liquid-instruments/liquid-instruments-moku-pro/)[1](https://www.mouser.com/new/liquid-instruments/liquid-instruments-moku-pro/)[2](https://www.photonics.com/Products/MokuPro/pr66405). [It can host multiple instruments on a single device without sacrificing specs or precision](https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokupro/)[3](https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokupro/).
			- Some similar instruments to the Moku:Pro are:
				- The Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14, which is also a software-defined instrument that can perform various functions such as oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, signal generator and more. It has a lower bandwidth (50 MHz) and sampling rate (125 MS/s) than the Moku:Pro, but it is also cheaper ($299).
				- The NI PXIe-5646R, which is a vector signal transceiver that combines an RF signal generator and analyzer with FPGA-based real-time signal processing. It has a higher bandwidth (200 MHz) and sampling rate (250 MS/s) than the Moku:Pro, but it also requires additional modules and software to operate. It costs $19,999.
				- The Analog Discovery 2, which is a USB-powered device that can perform various functions such as oscilloscope, waveform generator, logic analyzer and more. It has a lower bandwidth (30 MHz) and sampling rate (100 MS/s) than the Moku:Pro, but it is also much cheaper ($279).
