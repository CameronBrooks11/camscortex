	- ML that processes numerous textbooks to consolidate the beast information on each subject and concept in order to create better knowledge maps
	- Improve education for post-secondary engineering education
	  collapsed:: true
		- Start with Western on the classes you took and use it as an opening for consulting on all courses within the department
		- Use things like 2Blue1Brown, 3D scanning of texts to create 3D models, the use of interactive circuits and graphs directly in slideshows (will need something other than PP, OS alt?)
		- Eventually expand to science and beyond
	- Aquatic animal market is very expensive and easy to replicate
	- Using AI machine learning and deep learning have a robotic system simulate going through a surgery and see what it comes up with. You can trade it on 3-D scans and computer reconstructions of tissue.
	- Productivity and planning app
