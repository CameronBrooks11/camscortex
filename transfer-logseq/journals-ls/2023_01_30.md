			- Conductive thermoplastic polymers are an ever-growing field in scientific research. They have found applications in various branches, such as aerospace and automotive manufacturing, electrical engineering, and consumer electronics. These materials are acknowledged for their unique properties, being simultaneously flexible, strong, and highly conductive.
			  
			  3D Printing has recently become one of the most popular techniques available for producing objects with thermoplastic polymers. The process involves melting and extruding a plastic filament, which is then used to build the object in a pre-defined shape. 
			  
			  Here we present a guide to the preparation of a conductive thermoplastic polymer 3D printer filament from recycled polylactic acid (PLA) plastic and copper, using a ball mill. This process may be adapted for other materials with different properties. 
			  
			  PLA is a biodegradable thermoplastic polymer, derived from natural sources such as corn or sugarcane. This material is commonly used for 3D printing due to its relatively low-temperature melting point (around 175C) and its relatively low viscosity when compared to other thermoplastic polymers, making it easier to extrude. 
			  
			  Copper, on the other hand, is one of the best conductive metals available and is the most commonly used in electrical applications. Copper has the highest electrical conductivity among all metals and is also very resistant to corrosion and temperature changes, making it one of the most sought-after metals for the production of conductive thermoplastic polymers. 
			  
			  In order to make a conductive thermoplastic polymer 3D printer filament from PLA and copper, we need to first grind up the copper into a powder. To do this, we can use a ball mill. A ball mill is a type of grinder which is used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and much more. The ball mill is composed of a cylindrical container mounted on a suitable bearing that can rotate along its horizontal axis. Inside the mill, a chamber is filled with a suitable grinding media such as steel balls or rods. The rotation of the chamber causes the grinding media to move and collide with each other, slowly reducing them into a fine powder. 
			  
			  Once the copper is in its powder form, we then need to mix it with the PLA. To do this, we need to first heat up the PLA until it melts completely, forming a viscous liquid. At this stage, the copper powder is added to the liquid. The viscosity of the mixture needs to be adjusted to ensure that it can be extruded by the printer later on. This can be done by adding more liquid PLA to the mix or by decreasing the temperature to allow the PLA to set quickly. Once the desired viscosity is achieved, the mixture is poured into a mold and allowed to cool and set.
			  
			  Once the mixture has cooled and set, it can then be removed from the mold and fed into the 3D printer. The printer will be able to extrude the filament in the desired shapes and form the 3D object. After the filament has been printed, the object can be used for its intended purpose. 
			  
			  In conclusion, the preparation of a conductive thermoplastic polymer 3D printer filament from recycled polylactic acid (PLA) and copper, using a ball mill, is a relatively simple process. This procedure can be adapted to other materials with different properties by adjusting the ratio of PLA and copper and the amount of heat needed to melt the PLA. The process involves grinding the copper into a powder, melting and mixing it with the PLA, and extruding it into the desired shapes with a 3D printer.
