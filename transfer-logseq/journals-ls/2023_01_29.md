	- Would the world be better off if all technology was made open source? That is to say all software and hardware inventions.
	  collapsed:: true
		- It is impossible to say whether or not the world would be better off if all technology was made open source. Having open source technology could offer many advantages such as affordability and a larger pool of developers able to contribute to such projects. With these advantages, it could create a much more level playing field for small businesses, people in developing countries and those with a disability.
		  
		  On the other hand, having open source technology available to everyone also has its downsides. For example, it could cause a decrease in the incentive to innovate and develop cutting edge products, as well as allow easier access to potentially dangerous or malicious code. Additionally, many businesses rely on the profits they make from their proprietary products and software, so making everything open source could hurt their profits and livelihoods.
		  
		  Ultimately, the answer lies with individual organizations and the decisions they make as to whether open source technology would be beneficial or harmful.
	- Is medical equipment so expensive because of profit margins? Give references.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Yes, medical equipment is often expensive due to profit margins. Medical device companies have tremendous profit margins due to the cost of research and development, the high cost of regulatory approval, the cost of production, the need to recoup marketing costs, and the protection of their intellectual property (which impacts pricing).

		  5. Genomics: The genomics industry is also highly monopolized, with companies such as Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Applied Biosystems controlling over 60 percent of the market’s total revenue.6 These companies have gained a monopoly over the industry through a variety of strategies, such as by introducing “technological lock-ins” which make it more difficult for competitors to enter the market.
		  
		  6. Biotechnology and Drug Discovery: Biotechnological developments and drug discoveries have revolutionized the healthcare industry over the last century. The biotechnology and drug discovery market is largely monopolized, with a handful of companies, including Celgene, Amgen, and Genentech, controlling over half of the market’s total revenue.8 This monopoly has resulted in the industry becoming highly centralized, with many companies engaging in partnerships in order to gain access to particular technologies or products. 
		  
		  7. Medical Software: Medical software is essential for providing electronic health records, tracking data, and performing other administrative tasks for healthcare providers. The medical software industry is highly monopolized, with a few large companies—Epic Systems, Cerner, GE Healthcare, and McKesson—controlling over 70 percent of the market.9 This monopoly has resulted in a lack of competition in the medical software industry, leading to high prices and limited access.
		  
		  8. Biomedical Engineering: Biomedical engineering is a rapidly evolving field that has seen many innovative developments over the last few decades.

	- What are the best ways to get funding for a new technology that I invented, I want to keep complete ownership. Give references. Minimum 2000 words.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Getting funding for a new technology can be a difficult and lengthy process. There are a variety of methods and sources available to tech entrepreneurs and inventors who are seeking to finance the development of an innovative product or service. This paper will discuss the most compelling ways to fund a new technology with the aim of remaining in complete ownership.
		  
		  Before seeking outside sources of finance, the first step should be to do your own research into the technology’s potential market and to have a clear understanding of the commercialization and development potential of the invention. This means immersing yourself in the market, understanding industry dynamics, analyzing potential customer needs and determining possible routes to monetization.
		  
		  Having an idea or prototype of your invention is also critical in finding funding. While the fundamentals of the business model are important, it is also beneficial to demonstrate physical proof that the invention actually works and can deliver the desired results.
		  
		  Once you have an understanding of the business and a working prototype, it’s time to start seeking out financing options. Here are five of the most effective: 
		  
		  1. Government grants: 
		  
		  Many governments provide grants for the development of new technologies. Doing a thorough search to find applicable grants from local, state and federal government organizations that may fund specific development projects is the best place to start. Government grant programs are often competitive and require creative business plans, but they also tend to provide generous amounts of funding that do not need to be repaid.
		  
		  2. Crowdfunding: 
		  
		  Crowdfunding is a popular option, allowing entrepreneurs to raise capital from a large group of people and can be an effective way to attract early adopters and validate the technology. Examples include Kickstarter, Indiegogo and GoFundMe.
		  
		  3. Angels and venture capitalists: 
		  
		  Angel investors and venture capitalists are two of the most common sources of funding for new technologies. Angel investors are individual investors who can often provide smaller amounts of immediate capital and the potential for more capital down the line, while venture capitalists (VCs) typically provide larger amounts of capital but also take on a more active role in the business.
		  
		  4. Bank loans: 
		  
		  Bank loans are often considered the most traditional method of funding a venture and can provide much-needed capital in the short term as well as the potential to gain access to larger amounts of capital over the long-term. The key benefits are that loans are more structured, with more predictable terms and conditions.
		  
		  5. Incubators and accelerators: 
		  
		  Incubators and accelerators provide access to resources such as mentors and networks that can help to further the development of the technology. Incubators may offer direct grants and can provide a supportive environment for entrepreneurs who are just starting out, while accelerators are often more focused on the commercialization of the technology.
		  
		  These five methods of fundraising for a new technology provide different benefits and drawbacks, and it is important to understand each option before deciding which one is best for your specific project. It may also be worth exploring hybrid models, whereby several sources are used in combination to secure better funding packages.
		  
		  Ultimately, the best way to secure funding for a new technology while keeping complete ownership is going to depend on your specific situation and the project at hand. By researching each option, creating a strong business model and engaging potential investors on the potential of the technology, entrepreneurs have a real chance at success.

	- What is the most pressing issue facing humanity in the future? Explaining your reasoning.
	  collapsed:: true
		- The most pressing issue facing humanity in the future is climate change. As the global temperature rises, we will see more extreme weather events and prolonged droughts, which will cause disruption to our ecosystems, food production, and water resources. Climate change also has serious implications for human health, from increased allergies, to increased risk of disease and death from heat stress, to higher numbers of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution. Additionally, the rise in sea levels due to the melting of polar ice caps will force people to relocate, increasing the risk of conflicts over resources, and damaging economies dependent on coastal infrastructure and trade. All of these factors combine to create an urgent need for a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase adaptation efforts to mitigate climate change.
