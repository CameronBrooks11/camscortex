- CC/CV refers to constant current/constant voltage #[[electrical-terms]]
- [[SRC module]] are basically [[Semiconductor]], or Silicon, Controlled Rectifiers in a modular package. SCR Modules are used to control and rectify current in only one direction. When a current/voltage pulse is applied to the gate of the SCR, it triggers on and starts to conduct. #[[electrical-terms]]
	- This is a type of [[Thyristor]] which is a solid-state [[semiconductor]] device with four layers of alternating P- and N-type materials used for high-power applications. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch (or a latch),[1]: 12  conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, and continuing to conduct until the voltage across the device is reversed biased, or until the voltage is removed (by some other means)
- A [[power inverter]], inverter or invertor is a [[power electronic device]] or circuitry that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) #[[electrical-terms]]
