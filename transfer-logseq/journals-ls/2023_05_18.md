- Just had a three good conversations mostly centered on the [[Libre Press]] big version but touched many other important items
	- First with [[Morgan Woods]] about using the mini press as a power press to create the housings for [[resistive heating]] elements. Our initial testing saw that the [[3D prints]] from high [[infill]] [[PETG]] was able to bend and form aluminum.
	- Next I hopped on with [[Joshua Pearce]] and filled him in on the conversation and testing with Morgan, then we both decided on $7,500 for electrical budget. I also mentioned [[Sara Ordonselli]] and her involvement with [[Precious Plastics]] in founding the [[Concordia Precious Plastic Project]] (CP3) and how I'm busy with [[How to Change the World]]. We will have to get [[CSA]] mark certification on the power supply for the big press.
	- Third conversation was with [[Ravneet Singh]] regarding [[CSA]] certification from his experience in industry at [[Airia Brands Inc.]]. Lots of good insights particularly on [[CSA Approved Electrical Enclosures]] and things like [[DIN Rails]], [[Strain Relief Connectors]], and [[Electrical Connectors]]
		- A resource that I found that might be good is: [ What Are the Kinds of Electrical Enclosures?](https://shiftednews.com/what-are-the-kinds-of-electrical-enclosures/) and [prometalcraft.com](https://prometalcraft.com/services/enclosures/enclosure-styles/double-door-stainless-electrical-control-enclosure-nema12-nema-12-ip54-ip-54-csa-type-12-1/)
