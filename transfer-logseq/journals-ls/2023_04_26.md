- #Electronix [[ringing choke]]
	- Text description
		- A ringing choke, also known as a "ringing choke converter" or "blocking oscillator," is an electronic component or circuit that is primarily used in switching power supplies, such as those found in compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and LED drivers. It is a type of inductor-based converter that can transform a DC (direct current) input voltage into an AC (alternating current) output voltage with a high frequency, typically in the range of tens to hundreds of kilohertz.
		  The ringing choke consists of an inductor (coil of wire) and a switching device, usually a transistor or a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor). The switching device alternately turns on and off at a high frequency, causing the current through the inductor to change rapidly. This rapid change in current induces a high-frequency voltage across the inductor, which is then rectified and filtered to produce the desired output voltage.
		  The term "ringing" comes from the oscillations in voltage and current that occur in the inductor when the switching device turns on and off. These oscillations resemble the ringing sound of a bell, hence the name "ringing choke."
		  Ringing chokes are widely used due to their simplicity, low cost, and ability to provide a compact solution for high-frequency power conversion. However, they can generate electromagnetic interference (EMI) and can be less efficient compared to other power conversion technologies, such as resonant converters or active power factor correction circuits.

	- The silicon wafer in question is likely an old one from a manual fab, with the number on it serving as a Lot/wafer ID for tracking purposes during production. Based on the pattern, it is likely a memory wafer with the logic/controller at the bottom and data storage cells at the top of each die. The wafer size can be used to estimate the production date, with 4 inches corresponding to the late 70s to mid 80s, 6 inches to 1985-1996, and 8 inches to 1996-2008.
	  The wafer shows signs of partial dicing, but the process was halted, possibly due to a dull blade, shattered blade, or incorrect calibration. The wafer was nearly finished, so most of the dies were likely functional. In the past, bad wafers were often discarded, but employees could sometimes keep them as gifts.
	  After further discussion, it is believed to be a [[Micron DDR2]] (or possibly flash memory) wafer produced between 2003 and 2008.
