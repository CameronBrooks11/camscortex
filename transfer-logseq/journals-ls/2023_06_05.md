		- The 1960s were a remarkable decade of change in terms of how people viewed technology. Before the 1960s, space travel was considered to be pure fantasy, the subject of science fiction novels and films conjured up by writers with vivid imaginations. [However, the beginning of the decade saw the first human beings flying through space and orbiting the Earth](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/culture-magazines/1960s-science-and-technology-overview)[1](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/culture-magazines/1960s-science-and-technology-overview). The decade also saw great strides in the evolution of computers. [More were produced, and they became more readily available for business and commercial use](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/culture-magazines/1960s-science-and-technology-overview)[1](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/culture-magazines/1960s-science-and-technology-overview). [The iconic technological products of the 60s—the microwave oven, the color television, the living room cabinet record player—these are of a different topic of discussion](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tech/six-tech-advancements-from-the)[2](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tech/six-tech-advancements-from-the).
