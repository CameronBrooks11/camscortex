- [[Computational Open Source Hardware]] for cx-OSH
	- relates to [[OSHWA]] and [[Open Technology Ecosystem Consortium]]
		- Technological Innovation Systems
- Apply to the [[Western Entrepreneurial Summer Internship]]
	- Using [[RackRobotics]] [[Wire EDM]] system to create all metal interlocking parts for mini press to reduce machining and welding needed
	- Make it all generative so customers can have complete control and can integrate into a [[BREAD]] system with clusters similar idea to how the [[Pioreactor]] does
- ### Evolution from Traditional to Computational Engineering: A Philosophical Shift
  collapsed:: true
	- **Traditional Engineering vs. Computational Engineering**
		- Traditional Engineering
			- Deterministic and manual approaches based on established principles.
			- Reliance on experience and manual calculations for design.
			- Designs are static; changes are costly and difficult.
		- Computational Engineering
			- Algorithmic and probabilistic methods for design and optimization.
			- Automated iteration and optimization of designs.
			- Dynamic and evolvable designs based on computational models.
	- **Benefits of Computational Engineering**
		- Efficiency in design and prototyping processes.
		- Accuracy through simulations and computational analysis.
		- Innovation facilitated by exploring complex designs.
		- Optimization of performance, efficiency, and sustainability.
	- ### Key Concepts and Terms
	- **Design as a Language (Algorithmic Design Philosophy)**
		- Views design and engineering as structured, explicit communication.
		- Promotes procedural creativity and explicit knowledge encoding.
		- Supports collaborative and iterative exploration.
	- **Technological Innovation Systems**
		- Science: Understanding natural phenomena through empirical methods.
		- Engineering: Applying scientific principles to solve real-world problems.
		- Design: Humanizing solutions to meet needs and desires.
	- ### Enhancing the Framework: Ethics and Sustainability
	- **Importance of Ethics and Sustainability**
		- Ensures responsible development and use of technology.
		- Integrates ethical analysis and sustainable design principles.
		- Promotes positive societal impact and environmental stewardship.
	- ### Comparative Analysis: Algorithmic vs. Heuristic Approaches
	- **Algorithmic Approach**
		- Defined by computational procedures and optimization algorithms.
		- Systematic and data-driven, leveraging AI for solution exploration.
	- **Heuristic Approach**
		- Based on experience, intuition, and educated guesses.
		- Flexible and adaptable, emphasizing human expertise and creativity.
	- ### Integration and Application
	- **Interplay of Science, Engineering, and Design**
		- Continuous innovation cycle from understanding to application to humanization.
		- Role of ethics and sustainability as cross-cutting considerations.
	- **Algorithmic vs. Heuristic in Technological Innovation Systems**
		- Algorithmic: Future-oriented, emphasizing automation and computational exploration.
		- Heuristic: Traditional, valuing human judgment and creativity.
- Need to look into [[FeatureScript]] for [[Onshape]] as a method of going SW and other closed formats to-> open
- also looks very useful for wiring etc I can take from
