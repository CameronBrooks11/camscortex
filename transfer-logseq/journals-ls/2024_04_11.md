- Since starting to help with the [[Roto Isolated Thermocouple Driver]] for the [[Rotoforge Project]] I've been looking into advanced tools and methods for high-sped PCB design
	- Learned out [[copper thieving]] while looking for KiCAD tools for this (https://github.com/mrussell42/copper_thief)
	- A good resource for developing boards in [[KiCAD]] using a keyboard as an example: (keyboard-pcb-design)[https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide]
	- I believe [[Antmicro]] has what I've been looking for in their blog on [High-frequency hardware design with open source signal integrity analysis](https://antmicro.com/blog/2023/11/open-source-signal-integrity-analysis/)
		- for this they created [github.com/antmicro/gerber2ems](https://github.com/antmicro/gerber2ems) which takes production files and simulates trace signal integrity performance using [openEMS](https://www.openems.de/)
	- This led to me delving more into [[Antmicro]] and their open hardware-software design flow that uses KiCAD and blender for CI development of hardware; [Antmicroâ€™s Open Hardware Portal - opening the hardware design process with KiCad and Blender](https://antmicro.com/blog/2023/04/open-hardware-portal/)
		- https://openhardware.antmicro.com/
		- https://github.com/antmicro
	- Found and saved some good pdf documents on PCB design saved to Textbooks driven under Electrical and Computer Engineering folder
	- Starting point for a active filter design add in project: https://forum.kicad.info/t/foss-filter-design-suite-with-kicad-schematics-as-output/21183
