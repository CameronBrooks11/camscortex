	- My master's thesis explores the integration of parametric design, artificial intelligence, and open-source principles to enhance engineering design efficiency. The objective is to harness AI's potential to streamline design processes by utilizing open-source tools as foundational elements. This approach necessitates the collection and storage of data, along with the establishment of a repository to facilitate access and utilization. A key component involves training machine learning models on platforms such as FreeCAD, KiCad, and OpenSCAD, among others, to automate and optimize design tasks. By employing Jupyter notebooks, I aim to create a cohesive environment that integrates these diverse tools, enabling seamless interaction between them.
	- The project envisions making the design process more accessible through user-friendly graphical interfaces or node-based programming, drawing inspiration from existing projects that employ node maps for generating OpenSCAD designs. This method aligns with the concept of abstracting complex engineering tasks into more manageable and understandable formats.
	- Additionally, my [[Airbrakes Capstone]] professor's reference to "the death of the analytical engineer" amidst the rise of CAD and electronic design automation (EDA) technologies underscores a pivotal shift in engineering paradigms. This transition suggests that while traditional analytical skills remain crucial, the future of engineering lies in leveraging computational tools to translate intricate problems into digital solutions efficiently. Once a problem is thoroughly understood, it can be swiftly encoded into a digital format, bridging the gap between conceptualization and realization.
	- Ultimately, this thesis posits that by leveraging AI and open-source software, it is possible to produce comprehensive designs that not only facilitate the conversion of digital data into physical objects (from "bits" to "atoms") but also ensure that these designs are easily shareable and replicable. This approach not only democratizes the design process but also enhances collaborative efforts, paving the way for a new era of engineering that balances innovation with accessibility.
