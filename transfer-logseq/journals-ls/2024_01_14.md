- Here is my dump of stuff trying to get my digital life organized
	- [[Shipping Container Homes]]
	- [[Consumer level distributed manufacturing]]
	- I tried once upon a time with [[Airostik]]
	- [[Small-Scale Manufacturing Using Repurposed Shipping Containers for FOSH Hardware]]
	- [[Trend-Based Trading with AI and Global Context Analysis]]
	- [[Bucket List]]
	- [[Organization]]
	- A list I made back in first year of university of [[Career Ideas August 15, 2020]]
	- [[Consolidated Comprehensive Tool List for Electrical Apprentices]]
	- [[Dream Property]]
	- [[Neural Engineering]]
	- [[ChatGPT]]
	- [[Modular Vertical Farming]]
	- I haven't played [[Golf]] in a while but I have stuff to write out and transfer including [[Golf Courses I've Played]], [[Parts of a Golf Club]], [[Golf Ball Placement]], [[Golf Swing]], [[Golf Grip]] and [[Tips for Golf Short Game]]
	- I think it would be nice to start a list of [[Organizations I, Cameron K. Brooks, Support]]
	- [[Tasks Dump]]
	- I need to transfer my [[Rough CV Planning 2024]]
	- [[Study Techniques and Habits]]
	- [[Core Principles and Concepts in Appropriate Development]]
	- [[Uncategorized Product and Service Ideas]]
	- I need an area for my, shall I say, [[Exploratory Theoretical Concepts]]
	- [[Parametric Open Source Cold-Frame Agrivoltaic Systems]]
	- [[Current PC Build]]
	- [[My Cookbook]]
	- Documenting a previous [[Idea]] of using [[porous 3D resin]] to create conductive structures using plating techniques. The proposal is that the porosity introduces a very high surface area for the surface reactions involved in the plating process to occur.
	- For my next [[laptop]] I want to get a [[Framework Computer]] laptop
	- Perhaps one of the most interesting [[OpenSCAD]] designs I've come across that I haven't dabbled with yet is [[RepRap]]'s [[Infinite-Z-Beam]] python script which was converted to [[OpenSCAD]] by David Eccles.
		- The file **Z-beam.scad** is an [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) set-theoretic (CSG) version by David Eccles that he did *a few hours after we released this*. **We all love open-source!**
		- This would be a very interesting idea to test out with [[Scientific Press Beta]] as the main [[structural components]] built around the produced sheets to create structural products.
	- Once I have the money I would like to buy a [[Flipper Zero]].
		- For fun and education of course.
	- [[Superconformal Electrodeposition]]
	- [[Liquid Metal Printing]]
	- [[Leidenfrost Effect]]
	- [[Noam Chomsky]]
	- [[Scripting in KiCAD]]
	- [[Fully Scripted Open Source Topology Optimization]]
	- Finally, inner peace (TEMP-DO) is done.
- Now onto real work (yay).
