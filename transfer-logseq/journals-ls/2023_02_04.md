		- How would I extract all the photos and figures from a pdf file or image file using python ocr such as pytesseract?
		  collapsed:: true
			- You can extract images and figures from a PDF or image file using OCR libraries such as PyTesseract in Python. Here's a basic outline of how you can accomplish this:
			- First, you need to install the PyTesseract library by running `pip install pytesseract`.
			- Next, you need to convert the PDF file to an image format (such as PNG or JPG) that PyTesseract can work with. You can use the `pdf2image` library for this, which you can install by running `pip install pdf2image`.
			- Once you have the image file, you can use PyTesseract to perform OCR on the image. You can use the following code to extract the text from an image:
				- ```
				  import pytesseract
				  from PIL import Image
				  image = Image.open("image.png")
				  text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
				  print(text)
				  ```
			- To extract images and figures, you can use the pdf2image library to extract all the images from the PDF file, then process each image using PyTesseract to determine if it contains any text or not. If the image does contain text, you can consider it a figure or chart; if it does not, you can consider it an image.
			  Here's an example of how you can extract all the images from a PDF file:
				- ```
				  from pdf2image import convert_from_path
				  
				  pages = convert_from_path("file.pdf")
				  for page in pages:
				      page.save("page.png", "PNG")
				  ```
				- This will save each page of the PDF file as a separate PNG image. You can then process each image using PyTesseract to extract the text and determine if it is a figure or an image.
		- Can you please go into depth on how I would decide if its an image/figure then save it? Please give detailed code.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Sure! Here's a sample code that demonstrates how you can extract images and figures from a PDF file, determine whether each extracted image is a figure or an image, and then save the figures and images separately:
				- ```
				  import pytesseract
				  from pdf2image import convert_from_path
				  from PIL import Image
				  
				  def is_figure(image):
				      # Perform OCR on the image
				      text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
				      
				      # If the OCR result is not empty, the image is considered a figure
				      if text:
				          return True
				      else:
				          return False
				  
				  # Convert the PDF to a list of images
				  pages = convert_from_path("file.pdf")
				  
				  # Iterate over each page
				  for i, page in enumerate(pages):
				      # Save the page as a PNG image
				      page.save(f"page_{i}.png", "PNG")
				      
				      # Load the image using the Image library
				      image = Image.open(f"page_{i}.png")
				      
				      # Determine if the image is a figure or an image
				      if is_figure(image):
				          # Save the figure
				          image.save(f"figure_{i}.png")
				      else:
				          # Save the image
				          image.save(f"image_{i}.png")
				  ```
				- The is_figure function takes an image as input and performs OCR on it using PyTesseract's image_to_string method. If the OCR result is not empty, the image is considered a figure and the function returns True. If the OCR result is empty, the image is considered an image and the function returns False.
				- In the main code, we use the pdf2image library to convert the PDF to a list of images. We then iterate over each page and save it as a PNG image. We then load the image using the Image library and pass it to the is_figure function to determine whether the image is a figure or an image. If the image is a figure, we save it with the prefix figure_, and if it is an image, we save it with the prefix image_.
		- No the code is wrong, I need the figures from a pdf that contains text and multiple images. I want the text isolated from the figures contained within the pdf file.
		  collapsed:: true
			- I apologize for the confusion. Here's an updated code that extracts the text and figures separately from a PDF file:
				- ```
				  import pytesseract
				  import os
				  from pdf2image import convert_from_path
				  from PIL import Image
				  
				  def extract_text(image):
				      return pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
				  
				  def is_figure(image):
				      # Perform OCR on the image
				      text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, config='--psm 6')
				      
				      # If the OCR result is not empty, the image is considered text
				      if text:
				          return False
				      else:
				          return True
				  
				  # Convert the PDF to a list of images
				  pages = convert_from_path("file.pdf")
				  
				  # Iterate over each page
				  for i, page in enumerate(pages):
				      # Save the page as a PNG image
				      page.save(f"page_{i}.png", "PNG")
				      
				      # Load the image using the Image library
				      image = Image.open(f"page_{i}.png")
				      
				      # Determine if the image is a figure or text
				      if is_figure(image):
				          # Save the figure
				          image.save(f"figure_{i}.png")
				      else:
				          # Save the text
				          text = extract_text(image)
				          with open(f"text_{i}.txt", "w") as file:
				              file.write(text)
				      
				      # Delete the PNG image
				      os.remove(f"page_{i}.png")
				  ```
				- This code works similarly to the previous code, but with some modifications. The extract_text function takes an image as input and performs OCR on it using PyTesseract's image_to_string method. The is_figure function uses the OCR result to determine if the image is text or a figure. If the OCR result is not empty, the image is considered text and the function returns False. If the OCR result is empty, the image is considered a figure and the function returns True.

If the image is text, we extract the text using the extract_text function and save it to a text file with the prefix text_. If the image is a figure, we save it as an image with the prefix figure_. Finally, we delete the PNG image to free up disk space.
		- Now I want a complete program that extracts all texts and images/figures from a pdf file containing an arbitrary arrangement of text and images/figures. I want each paragraph to be a numbered string and each image to be numbered. The numbering should be based on reading order.

				      # Delete the PNG image
				      os.remove(f"page_{i}.png")
				  ```
				- This code is similar to the previous code, with a few modifications. We added two counters, text_counter and figure_counter, to keep track of the number of texts and figures respectively. In the loop, when we save a text, we use text_counter as the suffix for the file name. When we save a figure, we use figure_counter as the suffix for the file name. This way, each text and each figure will have a unique number based on their reading order.
		- *New stream*
		- I want a python script that uses pytesseract to extract figures from pdf files. The pdf file in question will contain text and images such similar to a textbook or book. Number the images based on reading order and save them.

				  # Initialize the image counter
				  img_counter = 1
				  
				  # Loop through each page of the PDF

				      page = pdf_file.getPage(page_num)
				      page_images = page["/Resources"]["/XObject"].getObject()
				  
				      # Loop through each image on the page
				      for img_id, img in page_images.items():

				              img = Image.open(data)
				  
				              # Use pytesseract to extract text from the image

				              img.save(f"image_{img_counter}.png")
				              img_counter += 1
				  ```
				- This script uses the PyPDF2 library to read the PDF file and the PIL library to process the images. The pytesseract library is used to extract text from the images, but you can modify this code to use the image_to_boxes or image_to_data functions if you need to extract other information from the images.
		- Okay now build on that code for that it also extracts any text that is not an image paragraph by paragraph. The number should be such that it uses the same as the images. For example if there is a paragraph then an image then a paragraph then it will extract paragraph 1 and store it then image 2 and store it then extra paragaph 2 and store it.

				- This script extracts the text from each page of the PDF file and saves it to separate text files along with the images. The counter variable is used to keep track of the number of images and paragraphs, so they are saved with the same number.

				- This script extracts the text and images from each page of the PDF file 
				  and saves them with a numbered file name based on the reading order. The `counter` variable is incremented each time an image or text is saved, so they are numbered in the order they appear in the PDF file.
		- Create a python program that uses pytesseract to bound boxes around all the paragraphs (not individual words) and figures/images in a .pdf document that may have more than one paragraph or figure/image on any page. The bounding boxes should be assigned enumerated variables that relate to the logical reading order of the bounding box in question.
			- Here's a sample code to do that using the pytesseract and PyPDF2 libraries in Python:
				- ```
				  import PyPDF2
				  import pytesseract
				  import cv2
				  import numpy as np
				  
				  # Load the PDF file
				  pdf_file = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(open('sample.pdf', 'rb'))
				  
				  # Initialize variables for bounding box enumeration
				  box_index = 1
				  para_boxes = []
				  image_boxes = []
				  
				  # Loop through each page of the PDF
				  for page_num in range(pdf_file.getNumPages()):
				      # Extract the text and images from the page
				      page = pdf_file.getPage(page_num)
				      text = pytesseract.image_to_data(page.extract_text(), output_type='data.frame')
				      images = page.extract_images()
				      
				      # Find the bounding boxes for each paragraph in the page
				      para_bboxes = []
				      for i in range(len(text)):
				          if text.conf[i] > 0:
				              (x, y, w, h) = (text.left[i], text.top[i], text.width[i], text.height[i])
				              para_bboxes.append((x, y, x + w, y + h))
				      # Group the paragraph bounding boxes into page-level bounding boxes
				      para_bboxes = cv2.groupRectangles(para_bboxes, 0.1, 0.5)
				      for (x1, y1, x2, y2) in para_bboxes:
				          para_boxes.append((box_index, x1, y1, x2, y2))
				          box_index += 1
				          
				      # Find the bounding boxes for each image in the page
				      for img in images:
				          image = img[0]
				          (x1, y1, x2, y2) = img[1]
				          image_boxes.append((box_index, x1, y1, x2, y2))
				          box_index += 1
				  
				  # Print the resulting bounding boxes for paragraphs and images
				  print("Paragraph bounding boxes:")
				  print(para_boxes)
				  print("Image bounding boxes:")
				  print(image_boxes)
				  ```
				- Note: This code assumes that the text in the PDF is properly formatted with consistent font sizes, spacing, and margins, as this will affect the accuracy of the bounding boxes generated by pytesseract.
		- Okay now just very slightly change that code so that instead of printing the paragraph bounding boxes and image bounding boxes they are instead saved as variables in a list.

				          (x1, y1, x2, y2) = img[1]
				          image_boxes.append((box_index, x1, y1, x2, y2))
				          box_index += 1
				  ```
				- You can access the resulting bounding boxes as para_boxes and image_boxes lists respectively.
			-
		- No tweak it again so that the paragraph bounding boxes and the image/figure bounding boxes are saved in the same list in and enumerated in logical reading order.
			- Here's another modified version of the code that saves both the paragraph and image bounding boxes in the same list in logical reading order:
				- ```
				  import PyPDF2
				  import pytesseract
				  import cv2
				  import numpy as np
				  
				  # Load the PDF file
				  pdf_file = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(open('sample.pdf', 'rb'))
				  
				  # Initialize a list to store the bounding boxes
				  boxes = []
				  
				  # Loop through each page of the PDF
				  for page_num in range(pdf_file.getNumPages()):
				      # Extract the text and images from the page
				      page = pdf_file.getPage(page_num)
				      text = pytesseract.image_to_data(page.extract_text(), output_type='data.frame')
				      images = page.extract_images()
				      
				      # Find the bounding boxes for each paragraph in the page
				      para_bboxes = []
				      for i in range(len(text)):
				          if text.conf[i] > 0:
				              (x, y, w, h) = (text.left[i], text.top[i], text.width[i], text.height[i])
				              para_bboxes.append((x, y, x + w, y + h))
				      # Group the paragraph bounding boxes into page-level bounding boxes
				      para_bboxes = cv2.groupRectangles(para_bboxes, 0.1, 0.5)
				      for (x1, y1, x2, y2) in para_bboxes:
				          boxes.append(('paragraph', x1, y1, x2, y2))
				          
				      # Find the bounding boxes for each image in the page
				      for img in images:
				          image = img[0]
				          (x1, y1, x2, y2) = img[1]
				          boxes.append(('image', x1, y1, x2, y2))
				  
				  # Sort the bounding boxes in logical reading order
				  boxes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[2]))
				  
				  # Enumerate the bounding boxes
				  for i, box in enumerate(boxes):
				      box = (i+1,) + box[1:]
				      boxes[i] = box
				  ```
				- The resulting list of bounding boxes can be accessed as the boxes list.
