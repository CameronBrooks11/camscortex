# Zettelkasten Method

## The Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method

Are you new to the Method?

Read the Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method and learn what makes the Zettelkasten work as a system, how to create notes, how to connect notes to make a web of knowledge, and how to create structures so you stay in control of the growing knowledge web.

Using a Zettelkasten is about optimizing your workflow of learning and producing knowledge. The products are texts, mostly. The categories we find fit the process well at the moment are the following:

- **Knowledge Management**: General information about what it means to work and learn efficiently.
- **Writing**: Posts on the production of lasting knowledge and about sharing it with others through your own texts.
- **Reading**: Posts about the process of acquiring new things and organizing sources.

## Common Questions

- **How many Zettelkästen should I have?** Most likely, only one for the duration of your life, but there are exceptions.
- **Don’t use categories. Use tags instead.**
- **What should my first note be?** It doesn’t matter—just get started.
- **Set links between notes.** Full-text search on its own provides not enough information. Connections will do, especially in the long run.
- **When should I start a new note?**
  - Also read “Trust the process,” an essay.
- You must interpret your sources and then rely on your own thoughts henceforth to get the maximum benefit. Collecting information does not increase your knowledge.
- Use outlines to start with the first draft of your writing project.
- Ease into writing by adding Zettel notes to the outline, pasting their contents in.
- Everything you want to know about “Folgezettel”: a curated overview.

## Principles

- **Principle of Atomicity**: Put things that belong together into a single note, give it an ID, but limit its content to that single topic.
- **Principle of Connectivity**: Highlights how different techniques can implement the same underlying principle, like links vs note sequences.

## Knowledge Management

The building blocks of a Zettelkasten are the inbox, the note archive, and the reference manager.

### Basics to Get Started:

- Use a real notebook to capture thoughts.
- Write notes for your note archive in a way you’ll understand later.
- Add identity to things in the system to make references possible.
- Don’t use categories; use tags instead.
  - **Good and bad tags explained**: Some tagging habits will get in your way eventually.
- Set links between notes. Search alone is not enough.
- Every Zettel has two forms: an inner and outer form.

### Scaling Your Note Archive:

- Use temporary “buffer” notes to collect items for later re-arrangement.
- With time, multiple **Layers of Evidence** will emerge:
  - **Data description and patterns.**
  - **Interpretation of descriptions and patterns.**
  - **Synthesis of patterns, descriptions, and interpretation.**
- Add **Structural Layers** through links:
  - **Bottom Layer**: Content
  - **Middle Layer**: Structure Notes
  - **Top Layer**: Main Structure Notes and Double Hashes (special tags)

## Writing

- Make writing a part of your identity by scheduling time and creating lasting habits.
- **Getting started with writing projects:**
  - Buffer files in your Zettelkasten are great for storing writing ideas.
  - Use outlines to start with the first draft, then ease into writing by adding Zettel notes.
  - Divide composing from editing to reach a state of flow and complete projects faster.
- Publish iteratively.

## Reading

- Create a bibliography as part of your toolkit to track sources.
- Use the **Barbell Method of Reading**:
  - Read thoroughly and invest time when necessary.
  - Skim quickly for the rest.
- Take proper reading notes instead of leaving annotations in the margin.
- **Reading online**:
  - Use and manage RSS feed subscriptions to read efficiently.
