# bowden-drive

A bowden drive is a type of filament feeding mechanism used in 3D printers where the extruder motor is mounted away from the hotend. The filament is pushed through a long, flexible tube (called a Bowden tube) to reach the hotend. This setup reduces the weight on the moving parts of the printer, allowing for faster print speeds and improved print quality.
