- [[Abstract]]
	- The use of Alcohol-based antiseptics is efficient and approved, however it has some limitations. This paper examined the possibility of using hypochlorite water as a chlorine-based antiseptic for handwashing in public buildings and healthcare facilities. The electrolysis method was used, which produces Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from mixing drinking water with small amounts of sodium hydroxide. Hypochlorous acid is usually produced by blood cells to surround pathogens when the skin is cut and exposed to pathogens. The methods used were based on hydrolysing drinking water at a different salt concentration (from 0 up to saline water 0.9% NaCl) under the different power supply. The results showed that 0.005–0.01% hydrochloride water can be a perfect antiseptic that can kill most bacteria and pathogenies within 12 s. In one prototype set up one litter of the prepared solution needed the only 2 g of NaCl, 12 V and 3 amps' power. However, the pH value should be maintained to be around 5–6. The results also showed that the most efficient way was to produce the solution on-site. However, if stored properly it can be used for 7–10 days after production.
