## Position Vector in Rectangular Coordinates
	- The position of a particle \( P \) is defined by rectangular coordinates \( x, y, \) and \( z \).
	- The position vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is resolved as \( \mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k} \).
- ## Velocity and Acceleration Components
	- Differentiating the position vector \( \mathbf{r} \), the velocity \( \mathbf{v} \) is \( \mathbf{v} = \dot{x}\mathbf{i} + \dot{y}\mathbf{j} + \dot{z}\mathbf{k} \).
	- The acceleration \( \mathbf{a} \) is obtained by differentiating the velocity vector: \( \mathbf{a} = \ddot{x}\mathbf{i} + \ddot{y}\mathbf{j} + \ddot{z}\mathbf{k} \).
- ## Scalar Components of Velocity and Acceleration
	- Scalar components of velocity: \( v_x = \dot{x}, \) \( v_y = \dot{y}, \) \( v_z = \dot{z} \).
	- Scalar components of acceleration: \( a_x = \ddot{x}, \) \( a_y = \ddot{y}, \) \( a_z = \ddot{z} \).
- ## Significance of Positive and Negative Values
	- Positive \( v_x \) indicates velocity to the right; negative indicates to the left.
	- Similar interpretations apply for \( v_y, v_z, a_x, a_y, \) and \( a_z \).
- ## Independent Motion in Each Direction
	- The motion in \( x, y, \) and \( z \) directions can be considered separately if \( a_x, a_y, \) and \( a_z \) depend only on \( t, x, v_x, y, v_y, z, \) and \( v_z \) respectively.
- ## Projectile Motion Example
	- In projectile motion without air resistance:
		- \( a_x = 0, a_y = -g, a_z = 0 \) (where \( g \) is gravitational acceleration).
		- Integration yields equations for velocity and position in each direction.
	- For a projectile fired in the \( xy \) plane from the origin:
		- Horizontal motion (\( x \)) is uniform.
		- Vertical motion (\( y \)) is uniformly accelerated.
		- The projectile remains in the \( xy \) plane with \( z = 0 \).
- ## Trajectory of a Projectile
	- Equations defining \( x \) and \( y \) are parametric equations of a parabola.
	- The trajectory of a projectile is parabolic but can be affected by air resistance or gravity variation with altitude.
