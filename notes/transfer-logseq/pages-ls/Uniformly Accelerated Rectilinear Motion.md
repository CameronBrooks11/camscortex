## Definition
	- Uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion involves constant acceleration \( a \) of the particle, distinct from uniform rectilinear motion.
- ## Velocity Equation
	- The velocity \( v \) of the particle is given by \( v = v_0 + at \), where \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity.
	- Derived by integrating the acceleration equation \( \frac{dv}{dt} = a = \text{constant} \).
- ## Position Equation
	- Position \( x \) is determined by integrating the velocity equation.
	- If \( x_0 \) is the initial position, the integration results in \( x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2 \).
- ## Velocity-Position Relationship
	- Another useful relation is obtained by integrating \( v dv = a dx \), leading to \( v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0) \).
- ## Application and Limitations
	- These equations are particularly relevant for describing the motion of a freely falling body (acceleration denoted by \( g \)).
	- They are applicable only when acceleration is constant.
	- For variable acceleration, motion must be analyzed using fundamental equations and methods as outlined in previous sections.
- ## Choosing a Reference Frame
	- Before using these equations, define the origin \( O \) of the x-axis and choose a positive direction.
	- The signs of \( a \), \( v_0 \), and \( x_0 \) depend on this chosen direction.
