- [[Abstract]]
	- A simple Arduino-based potentiostat has been developed. This potentiostat design is cost 
	  effective for low budget applications and educational purposes. The resolution and linear 
	  response of the developed potentiosat was evaluated. A cyclic voltammetry of potassium 
	  ferricyanide K3[Fe(CN)6] was performed to compare the potentiostat electrochemical 
	  performance with a commercial one. To show the portable potentiostat capabilities, cyclic 
	  voltammograms were also performed at different scan rates. Finally, the diffusion coefficient 
	  of potassium ferricyanide was calculated in a solution containing a known concentration of the 
	  salt using the Randles-Sevcik equation
