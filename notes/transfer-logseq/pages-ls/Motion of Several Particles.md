## Independent Motion Along the Same Line
	- When multiple particles move independently along the same line, separate equations of motion are written for each.
	- Time and displacements should be recorded from the same initial point and in the same direction for all particles.
- ## Relative Motion of Two Particles
	- Consider particles A and B moving along the same line.
	- The relative position of B with respect to A, denoted as \( x_{B/A} \), is defined as \( x_{B/A} = x_B - x_A \).
	- A positive \( x_{B/A} \) indicates B is to the right of A; a negative value indicates B is to the left of A.
- ## Relative Velocity and Acceleration
	- Relative velocity \( v_{B/A} \) is the rate of change of \( x_{B/A} \), calculated as \( v_{B/A} = v_B - v_A \).
	- Relative acceleration \( a_{B/A} \) is the rate of change of \( v_{B/A} \), calculated as \( a_{B/A} = a_B - a_A \).
- ## Dependent Motions
	- Position of one particle can depend on another's position, termed as dependent motions.
	- Example: Position of block B depends on block A via a constant-length rope.
	- Such systems have a fixed number of degrees of freedom, determined by the relationship between the positions of the particles.
- ### Example: Two Blocks Connected by a Rope
	- Relation: \( x_A + 2x_B = \text{constant} \).
	- If block A moves by \( \Delta x_A \), block B moves by \( \frac{-1}{2} \Delta x_A \).
- ### Example: Three Blocks Connected by a Rope
	- Relation: \( 2x_A + 2x_B + x_C = \text{constant} \).
	- System has two degrees of freedom.
	- Velocities and accelerations of the blocks are linearly related.
- ## Linear Relationships in Multiple Particles
	- In cases with linear relations between positions of multiple particles, similar linear relations exist for their velocities and accelerations.
	- For instance, in a system of three blocks connected by a rope, velocities and accelerations of the blocks are linearly related.
