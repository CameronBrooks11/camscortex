# Open Source Appropriate Technology

Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT) refers to the development and dissemination of technologies that are designed to be accessible, sustainable, and suitable for local contexts, particularly in underserved or resource-limited communities. The principles of OSAT emphasize the use of open-source designs and collaborative development processes to create technologies that can be easily adapted, maintained, and improved by local users. OSAT aims to empower communities by providing them with the tools and knowledge needed to address their specific challenges in areas such as agriculture, water management, energy production, healthcare, education, and beyond.
