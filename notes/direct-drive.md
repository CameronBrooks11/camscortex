# direct-drive

Direct drive in it's most general sense means that the actuator (motor) is directly connected to the component it is driving without any intermediate mechanisms such as gears, belts, or pulleys. This direct connection allows for more precise control and immediate response to input commands.

In the context of 3D printing, a direct drive extruder refers to a setup where the extruder motor is mounted directly on top of the hotend. This means that the filament is pushed directly into the hotend without the need for a Bowden tube. Direct drive extruders are known for their ability to handle flexible filaments better and provide more accurate extrusion control, as there is less distance between the motor and the hotend. However, this setup can add weight to the moving parts of the printer, potentially affecting print speed and quality.
