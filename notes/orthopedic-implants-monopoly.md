# Orthopedic Implants Monopoly

- What is the most monopolized field of medical technology? Give references.

  - The most monopolized field of medical technology is (surprisingly) the field of orthopedic implants. According to a 2013 report by the Physicians for Fair Competition, the top four orthopedic implant companies, who produce 90% of the market share, are Zimmer, Stryker, DePuy, and Smith & Nephew. These companies are mostly responsible for monopolizing the orthopedic implant market and have been accused of anti-competitive behavior, resulting in higher orthopedic implant prices.
