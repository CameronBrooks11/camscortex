# Electrolyzed Hydrogen Production

Electrolyzed hydrogen production is a method of generating hydrogen gas ($H_2$) through the process of electrolysis. This involves using an electric current to split water ($H_2O$) into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen ($O_2$). The process can be represented by the following chemical equation:

$$ 2H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2H_2(g) + O_2(g) $$
