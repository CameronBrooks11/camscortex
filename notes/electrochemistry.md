# electrochemistry

Electrochemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the relationship between electrical energy and chemical changes. It involves the study of redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions, where electrons are transferred between species.

## Key Concepts

- **Redox Reactions**: These are chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between two species. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, while reduction is the gain of electrons.
- **Electrochemical Cells**: Devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy (or vice versa). They consist of two electrodes (anode and cathode) and an electrolyte.
  - **Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells**: Generate electrical energy from spontaneous redox reactions.
  - **Electrolytic Cells**: Use electrical energy to drive non-spontaneous chemical reactions.

## Electrodes

- Cathode: current exits and electrons enter
- Anode: current enters and electrons exit
- In a battery / cell, the anode is negative and the cathode is positive
  - Cathode --> oxidation (loss of electrons)
  - Anode --> reduction (gain of electrons)
- In electrolysis, the anode is positive and the cathode is negative
  - Anode --> oxidation (loss of electrons)
  - Cathode --> reduction (gain of electrons)
