# Material Extrusion System

## Filament Feeding Mechanism

There are various mechanisms to feed filament into the hotend, including:

- [[bowden-drive]] - A system where the extruder motor is mounted away from the hotend, pushing filament through a long tube.
- [[direct-drive]] - A system where the extruder motor is mounted directly on the hotend, providing more precise control over filament extrusion.
