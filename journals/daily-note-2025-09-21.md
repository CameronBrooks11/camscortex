## üìù Scratchpad

- Move [[Companies to Apply to Post-Graduation]] from GDrive

## üìã Daily Overview

- Priority tasks:
  - [x] Take stock of winder electrical and start redoing the electrical mounting and wiring
  - [x] All robotic manipulators lecture notes
  - [x] Do all example questions for tomorrow robotic manipulators in-lecture assessment

## üîç Work Log / Highlights

- What I worked on / achieved:
  - Took stock of winder electrical and started redoing the electrical mounting and wiring
    - Met and talked with Dylan, Liam and Alex about current rocketry projects
    - Removed old wiring and components from winder electrical box
    - Mounted new 12V power supply in the box, cut and mounted a base plate reused from avionics sled extras, mounted wago holders with connectors to sides, mounted the arduino mega + CNC shield and the the two external stepper motor drivers on the base plate
    - Sent message to Paris about meeting up on Tuesday to start rewriting the winder electrical and start reading her into the project
      - Scheduled meeting for Tuesday 5-7pm
  - Completed all robotic manipulators lecture notes
  - Finished all example questions for tomorrow's robotic manipulators in-lecture assessment
- Key issues encountered / resolved:
  - Literally all the winder wiring was a mess, so I had to take a lot of time to sort through it and figure out what was what
  - Had to figure out how to mount the new components in the electrical box, which took some time

## ‚òëÔ∏è Blockers / To-Do for Tomorrow

- Items blocked or deferred:
  - Some of the robotic manipulators examples remain to be done, blocked by me being tired and needing to sleep
- Tasks carry-over:
  - A few of the robotic manipulators example questions

## ü§î End-of-Day Reflection (2 minute)

- What went well:
  - I was able to take stock of the winder electrical and start redoing the electrical mounting and wiring
- What could be better:
  - I could have stayed on task better while working on robotic manipulators
- Actionable adjustment for tomorrow:
  - Set a timer for focused work sessions and take short breaks in between to maintain concentration
