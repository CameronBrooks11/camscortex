  - [[Solar]] powered robot that travels the ocean filtering out microplastics and fuses them together then returns them to land
  - In what level of the ocean are microplastics most abundant, give references.
    - [[Microplastics]] are most abundant in the surface layer of the [[ocean]] . According to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), concentrations of microplastics (particles smaller than 5 millimeters in diameter) were highest in the surface layer of the ocean, particularly in narrow coastal areas. The study also found that larger particles of plastic were more abundant in the deep ocean (below 200 meters).

  - The E4C Fellowship is a workforce development program in engineering for sustainable development that trains and empowers early-career engineers and technical professionals worldwide to tackle local and global challenges. It offers professional skills and leadership development, connects fellows with international mentors and peers across continents, and prepares them to deliver solutions aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through targeted research, analysis, and engagement with the E4C expert community.
  - Sponsored by mission-aligned organizations, E4C Fellows work remotely with diverse, interdisciplinary, multi-sector teams and develop their professional and technical skills by investigating, optimizing, and designing to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, [E4C’s Research page](https://www.engineeringforchange.org/research/). Fellows also focus on researching technology-based solutions that will be added to [E4C’s Solutions Library](https://www.engineeringforchange.org/solutions/products/), gaining expertise about available technologies and advancements and an understanding of the advancements, gaps, opportunities and good practices of technologies in various sectors in Engineering Sustainable Development. The program includes 400+ hours of research, 30 hours of online networking with peers and expert advisors, and 30 hours of learning modules.
