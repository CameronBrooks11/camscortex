# Logseq Journal - January 14, 2024

- Here is my dump of stuff trying to get my digital life organized
  - [[Shipping Container Homes]]
  - [[consumer-level-distributed-manufacturing]]
  - I tried once upon a time with [[airostik]]
  - [[Small-Scale Manufacturing Using Repurposed Shipping Containers for FOSH Hardware]]
  - [[Trend-Based Trading with AI and Global Context Analysis]]
  - [[bucket-list]]
  - [[Organization]]
  - A list I made back in first year of university of [[career-ideas]]
  - [[consolidated-comprehensive-tool-list-for-electrical-apprentices]]
  - [[dream-property]]
  - [[Neural Engineering]]
  - [[ChatGPT]]
  - [[Modular Vertical Farming]]
  - I haven't played [[golf]] in a while but I have stuff to write out and transfer including [[golf-courses-played]], [[Parts of a Golf Club]], [[Golf Ball Placement]], [[golf-swing]], [[golf-grip]] and [[Tips for Golf Short Game]]
  - I think it would be nice to start a list of [[Organizations I Support]]
  - [[Tasks Dump]]
  - I need to transfer my [[Rough CV Planning 2024]]
  - [[Study Techniques and Habits]]
  - [[Open Source Appropriate Technology]]
  - [[Uncategorized Product and Service Ideas]]
  - I need an area for my, shall I say, [[Exploratory Theoretical Concepts]]
  - [[Parametric Open Source Cold-Frame Agrivoltaic Systems]]
  - [[current-home-pc-build]]
  - [[My Cookbook]]
  - Documenting a previous [[Idea]] of using [[porous 3D resin]] to create conductive structures using plating techniques. The proposal is that the porosity introduces a very high surface area for the surface reactions involved in the plating process to occur.
  - For my next [[laptop]] I want to get a [[framework-computer]] laptop
  - Perhaps one of the most interesting [[OpenSCAD Learning resources]] designs I've come across that I haven't dabbled with yet is [[RepRap]]'s [[Infinite-Z-Beam]] python script which was converted to [[OpenSCAD Learning resources]] by David Eccles.
    - The file **Z-beam.scad** is an [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) set-theoretic (CSG) version by David Eccles that he did _a few hours after we released this_. **We all love open-source!**
    - This would be a very interesting idea to test out with [[Scientific Press Beta]] as the main [[structural components]] built around the produced sheets to create structural products.
  - Once I have the money I would like to buy a [[flipper-zero]].
    - For fun and education of course.
  - [[Superconformal Electrodeposition]]
  - [[Liquid Metal Printing]]
  - [[leidenfrost-effect]]
  - [[Noam Chomsky]]
  - [[Scripting in KiCAD]]
  - [[fully-scripted-open-source-topology-optimization]]
  - Finally, inner peace (TEMP-DO) is done.
- Now onto real work (yay).
