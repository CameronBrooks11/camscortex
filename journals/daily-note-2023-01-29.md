- Given two 3D printing materials: one is conductive and one is insulative, the approach for [[topological optimization]] of the conductive and insulative [[geometry]] to achieve a certain output for a given input is proposed as follows. Idea for [[AMCES]]

  1. Begin by defining the desired output from the given input.
  2. Identify a finite element model of the geometry, including all the material and electrical properties.
  3. Identify the optimized topology for the conductive and insulative materials.
  4. Create a mesh of the geometry and solve for the electrical potential and potential gradients.
  5. Use a finite-difference method to identify the influence of conductive and insulative material topology on electrical potential.
  6. Identify the most optimal combination of conductive and insulative material topology given the desired output.
  7. Use geometry optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing or sequential linear programming to further refine the topology of the conductive and insulative material.
  8. Perform sensitivity analysis to check that the model is responding in an expected manner.
  9. Iterate until the desired output is achieved.
