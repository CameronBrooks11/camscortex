- Morgan meeting with press
	- Angle grinded the brackets off but then all the drill presses are broken
		- Still need to be tapped
		- Couldn't weld them since they weren't done
	- Materials
		- All metal is collected in Fraunhofer
		- Fasteners are in lab in the black box but some are missing
			- Facca is 5 minutes away from fraunhoffer
		- Thermocouples are in lab and the fixings
	- Outstanding work
		- 4-4.5" holes in the for lag bolts for forklift mounts to move it around
			- Rent a mag drill from battle field equipment rentals
				- $150 for one day, 8 holes so prob take one day
				- Need your own bit the rental doesnt give it (Rob or buy)
				- Counting on Rob at Fraunhoffer to lead on that
		- Grind and retap and weld on thermocouple mounts
		- Will need to be cleaned, sanded and painted (black armour all for heated areas)
			- Rest non heat rust paint
		- Need to drill 4 corner holes on each of the back steel sheets covering the backs of plates
			- Instead of tapping on the mounting tabs maybe weld a nut
		- We need to order and weld some moulds
		- We also need more insulation (ours went missing)
