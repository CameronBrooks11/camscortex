# Electroform Studio

The idea is software for controlled electroforming processes, allowing users to create intricate metal objects by depositing metal onto a substrate through an electrolytic bath. The software would provide tools for designing the object, selecting materials, and controlling the electroforming parameters such as current density, temperature, and time. Software would be heavy on electrochemical physics simulations to predict the outcome of the electroforming process based on user-defined parameters.
